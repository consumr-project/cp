'''Albertsons Companies Inc.'''<ref name="albertsons.com"/><ref name="albertsons.com1"/> is an American grocery company founded and based in [[Boise, Idaho]].

In January 2015, it acquired [[Safeway Inc.]] for $9.2 billion.<ref name=donedeal/> The newly merged company has more than 2,200 stores and over 250,000 employees,<ref name="merger">{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/articles/safeway-shareholders-approve-albertsons-merger-1406327525|title= Safeway Shareholders Approve Albertsons Merger | author= Maria Armental |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=July 25, 2014|accessdate=August 1, 2014}}</ref> which makes it the second largest supermarket chain in North America after [[Kroger]], which has 2,424 stores. Prior to the merger it had 1,075 [[supermarket]]s located in 29 U.S. states under 12 different banners. Its predecessor company, Albertsons, Inc., was sold to Albertsons LLC (a [[Cerberus Capital Management]]-led consortium), [[CVS Pharmacy]], and [[SuperValu (United States)|SuperValu Inc.]] in 2006. CVS acquired the freestanding drugstores while the Cerberus-led consortium (Albertsons LLC) and Supervalu (New Albertsons, Inc.) divided the supermarket divisions among themselves.  After selling the majority of its stores to various buyers, in January 2013, Albertsons LLC, acquired SuperValu's remaining Albertsons stores, as well as its [[Acme Markets|ACME]], [[Jewel-Osco]], [[Lucky Stores|Lucky]], [[Shaw's and Star Market]] brands, in exchange for $100 million in cash and $3.2 Billion in SuperValu debt. The sale was completed by March 2013. The company's corporate name was Albertson's until 2002, when the apostrophe was removed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/08/06/news_pf/Business/Stores_get_less_posse.shtml|title=Stores get less possessive |first=Mark|last=Albright |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |date= August 6, 2002 |accessdate= October 16, 2014}}</ref>

==History==

===Beginnings===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
Albertsons was founded by [[Joe Albertson]] in 1939 in [[Boise, Idaho]]. An ad in the ''[[Idaho Statesman]]'' newspaper touted Joe Albertson's first store as "Idaho's largest and finest food store."  The store was filled with perks that, at the time, were brand new: free parking, a money-back guarantee, and even an ice cream shop.  The original store was built onto several times, but it was demolished in 1979 and a replacement store built on the same property.  A brick monument stands on the northwest corner of 16th and State Streets in downtown Boise, commemorating the original store.
[[File:Albertson's cheese department, 1955.jpg|thumb|The cheese department of an Albertson in Seattle (1955)]]
Joe Albertson's grocery store was an enormous success, and he plowed his profits back into the business.  New stores were opened in neighboring towns to the west, [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], [[Caldwell, Idaho|Caldwell]], and [[Emmett, Idaho|Emmett]], before [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] in late 1941.  The company grew steadily in the years following [[World War II]].  When Albertson was considering putting a new store in a town, he would drive around the town and look for neighborhoods with lots of children's clothing hanging on clotheslines; he knew that those kinds of neighborhoods were where he wanted to build his stores.

Albertsons, Inc. became a public company in 1959, and its growth continued, opening its 100th store in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] in 1964.  In 1966, Albertsons expanded to southern [[California]] by acquiring '''Greater All American Markets''', a small chain in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].

===Partnering with Skaggs===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
In 1969, Albertsons partnered with [[Skaggs Drug Centers]], owned by [[Skaggs Companies|The Skaggs Companies, Inc.]], to create the first combination food/drug stores. The partnership was a tremendous success for several years. The partnership ended due to the fact that it was getting more difficult to control. Neither partner could buy each other out, and the partnership was dissolved amicably in 1977. Skaggs kept stores in [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Arkansas]], and Albertsons kept stores in [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], and [[Louisiana]], as well as some [[Texas]] stores.  Albertsons added three [[Skaggs-Alpha Beta]] stores in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] within months after entering that market in early 1989 with the acquisition of six [[Tom Thumb Food & Pharmacy]] stores. In 1992, seventy-four of the remaining Skaggs stores (having been through several names under Skaggs/American Stores control, first "Skaggs SuperCenters", then "Skaggs-Alpha Beta", and finally "[[Jewel-Osco]]") in Oklahoma, Florida, Arkansas, and Texas were acquired by Albertsons from Skaggs/American Stores, including all 53 Jewel-Osco stores in Texas. Albertsons would increase its store count in the Dallas-Fort Worth area by adding 41 Jewel-Osco stores to its 19 stores already in operation. (These were also stores that only months before were rebranded from Skaggs-Alpha Beta to Jewel-Osco.) The stores would be rebranded as Albertsons.

The Skaggs acquisition was a success, and the new stores were integrated into Albertsons' Texas division.  The ease of that acquisition and Albertsons' high-flying stock price led Albertsons to attempt expansion on a grand scale.  In a series of acquisitions in the late 1990s, Albertsons acquired '''[[Seessel's Supermarkets|Seessel's]]''' in the [[Memphis, Tennessee]] market; 14 [[Bruno's]] stores in the [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and eastern Tennessee markets; '''[[Smitty's (retailer)|Smitty's]]''' in the Springfield, Missouri market; '''Super One Foods''' in the [[Des Moines, Iowa]] market; and '''[[Buttrey Food & Drug]]''' in [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], and western [[North Dakota]].  All of those stores except Seessel's were re-bannered as Albertsons, and several new stores were built, concentrating growth in fast-growing markets throughout [[Tennessee]].  Of those acquisitions, only Buttrey was smoothly integrated into Albertsons; by the end of 2005, all of the Albertsons and Seessel's stores in Tennessee outside Memphis had been closed, and the rest had been sold to [[Schnucks]] of [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  The former Smitty's was divested to Price Cutter, and Super One was closed and the buildings sold.

=== American Stores ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
[[File:Albertsons 4.JPG|thumb|right|A typical Albertsons in Boise, Idaho.]]

In 1999, Albertsons made its biggest acquisition: [[American Stores Company]], which included the chains [[Acme Markets|ACME]] in [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]], [[Maryland]], and [[Delaware]]; [[Lucky Stores|Lucky]] in [[California]] and [[Nevada]]; [[Jewel (supermarket)|Jewel]] and Jewel-Osco in [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], and [[Michigan]], and two pharmacy chains: [[Osco Drug]] and [[Sav-on Drugs]]. The acquisition briefly made Albertsons the largest American grocery operator, with over 2,500 stores in 37 states, until [[Kroger]]'s acquisition of [[Fred Meyer]] closed the following month.  To make the acquisition, Albertsons was forced by anti-trust concerns to sell nearly 100 stores, primarily in [[California]], [[Nevada]], and [[New Mexico]]. In southern California, there were already Albertsons, so in order to not have two banners in the same area, Lucky stores were converted to the Albertsons banner in November 1999, and the Lucky brand name was retired.

In 2001, Albertsons sold its freestanding Osco Drug stores in the northeastern states to [[Jean Coutu Group]], a [[Canada|Canadian]] drug store company.  Those stores were re-branded as [[Brooks Pharmacy]] after the sale was completed in January 2002. In March 2005, Albertsons re-introduced the Osco brand name to the [[New England]]  region by way of its Shaw's and Star Market pharmacies. Also, Albertsons began issuing Albertsons Preferred Savings Cards.

Albertsons exited the [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]], market in April 2002 by closing its 20 remaining area stores after already shuttering three other stores in December 2001. Albertsons was ranked as the area's number two grocer by market share, compared to [[H-E-B]]'s top position in the market. At the time of the withdrawal, the 44-store H-E-B chain held a commanding 61 percent market share, while Albertsons held a 15 percent market share. Albertsons had held the third position at the time [[Kroger]] exited the market in mid-1993 when it closed its 15 area stores. Then, H-E-B's 37 area stores held a 43.2 percent market share, Kroger's 15 area stores a 13.7 percent share, and Albertsons' 10 stores a 13.1 percent share.

Also in 2002, Albertsons sold its Seessel's supermarket chain in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and parts of [[Mississippi]] to [[Schnucks]], [[Brookshire's]], and pulled out of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], closing its 43 area stores leaving them to [[Kroger]] and [[Randall's Food Markets|Randalls]] after entering that market in 1990.

In 2004, Albertsons acquired [[Shaw's Supermarkets]] and [[Star Market]] Company from [[Sainsbury's]] for $2.5 billion. During the same time, Albertsons exited the markets of [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]] and [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]; closing over 20 stores. However, the company has since re-entered the New Orleans market.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Sale to SuperValu, CVS, and Cerberus ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
The acquisition spree caused significant problems for Albertsons, Inc.  Many of the acquired chains had systems that did not mesh well with Albertsons. Financing those acquisitions required Albertsons Inc. to take on significant debt.  Added to those problems were significant changes in consumer buying patterns, including new competition from large discounters such as [[Walmart]] and [[Costco]] that impacted sales.

After several reorganizations and waves of store closings, on January 23, 2006, Albertsons, Inc.,was acquired by [[SuperValu (United States)|SuperValu]], a [[Cerberus Capital Management|Cerberus]]-led group of investors, and [[CVS Pharmacy]]. The acquisition was completed on June 2, 2006 with the Cerberus-led group (who also included [[Kimco Realty Corporation]], [[Schottenstein Stores Corp.]], Lubert-Adler Partners, and Klaff Realty) acquiring 661 stores and the distribution centers and offices from five of Albertsons divisions.  These five divisions were thought to be Albertsons' five weakest divisions, and conventional wisdom in the industry was that the stores would eventually be closed or sold to other operators.

As of June 2, 2006, the company's retail stores were divided as follows:
* SuperValu has acquired 1124 stores in the deal, including:
** ''ACME'' (134 locations)
** ''ACME Express'', ''Jewel Express'', and ''Albertsons Express'' (107 fuel centers)
** ''Albertsons'' (564 locations in Southern California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming) - '''New Albertsons Inc.''' (later sold to Albertsons LLC)<ref>{{cite web|title=Traditions & History|url=http://www.albertsons.com/our-company/traditions-history/|publisher=Albertsons|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}</ref>
** ''Bristol Farms'' (11 locations)
** ''Jewel'' and ''Jewel-Osco'' (198 locations)
** ''Lazy Acres'' (1 location)
** ''Max Foods'' (4 locations) (3 converted into ''[[Lucky Stores|Lucky]]'', 1 became Albertsons in July 2006)
** ''Osco Pharmacy'' and ''Sav-on Pharmacy'' (906 pharmacies)
** ''Save-A-Lot'' (2 stores franchised by Shaw's)
** ''Shaw's'' (169 locations)
** ''Star Market'' (20 locations)
** ''Distribution centers'' (11 centers)
* CVS acquired all (approximately 702) of the stand-alone ''Osco Drug'' and ''Sav-on Drugs'' rebranding them all as [[CVS Pharmacy]], though they closed approximately 100 of the acquired stores. Many CVS locations were close to Sav-on stores.
* The Cerberus-led group acquired:
** ''Albertsons'' (655 locations in Arizona, Northern California, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming - '''Albertsons LLC''')
** ''County Line Liquors'' (1 location)
** ''Grocery Warehouse'' (1 location)
** ''Jewel-Osco'' (2 locations)
** ''Max Foods'' (2 locations)
** ''Super Saver Foods'' (23 locations, 21 closed in late 2006)

=== Post-acquisition ===
Following the sale, Albertson's, Inc., was removed from the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]]. Albertsons LLC was the successor company to Albertsons according to SEC filings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Markit RED Notification: Albertson’s Inc|url=https://www.markit.com/news/Albertsons.pdf|publisher=markit|date=June 12, 2008}}</ref> New Albertsons Inc. assumed most of the debt but got most of the stores.

The five Albertsons Inc. divisions that remained as Albertson's LLC were the Dallas/Fort Worth division (Texas (except El Paso), Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas), the Rocky Mountain division (Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, and South Dakota), the Southwest division (Arizona, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas), the Florida division (Florida), and the Northern California division (northern California and northern Nevada).  Albertson's LLC has concentrated on rebuilding market share and its store base in its strongest areas, and divesting stores and other property in its weaker areas.

On June 6, 2006, only one week after Albertson's LLC was created, the company announced its intent to close 100 Albertsons stores by August 2006.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20060608/ai_n16483143?tag=rel.res1 Albertsons to close 100 of its stores] ''Deseret News'' (Salt Lake City), June 8, 2006.</ref> Those closures were spread across all five divisions.  Soon after, the company announced that it would be shutting down its online delivery service on July 21, 2006.<ref>[http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/food-stores/4261610-1.html Albertson's LLC to Close Shutter Online Shopping Service]{{Dead link|date=April 2015}} ''Progressive Grocer/AllBusiness.com'', July 13, 2006</ref> To distinguish the two companies, Albertsons LLC created a second website, '''AlbertsonsMarket.com'''.

In 2007, New Albertsons created the "Crazy About Food" slogan and campaign. At the same time, the company dropped spokesperson [[Patricia Heaton]]. In an effort to unify the entire SuperValu company, a new slogan was introduced at the end of 2008 throughout the company and is "Good Things are Just Around the Corner."<ref>[http://www.ktvb.com/news/localnews/stories/ktvbn-mar0907-crazy_about_food.34a70c2e.html Albertsons says it's "crazy" about food], ''KTVB-TV'', March 9, 2007. {{wayback|url=http://www.ktvb.com/news/localnews/stories/ktvbn-mar0907-crazy_about_food.34a70c2e.html |date=20150402160817 }}</ref> Previous slogans were "At Albertsons, We Think Like You Do.", "It's Your Store.", and "Helping Make Your Life Easier."

In June 2007, Albertson's LLC decided to discontinue its Preferred Savings Card Program, choosing instead offer discounted items to all of its customers.<ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/business/articles/0620biz-albertsons0620.html Albertsons to discontinue loyalty cards today]{{Dead link|date=April 2015}}, ''The Arizona Republic'', June 20, 2007.</ref> In September, 2007, all Albertsons stores in the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, and Florida markets began collecting their Albertsons Preferred Savings Cards.<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/bus/industries/retail/stories/092707dnbusalbertsonscard.11053c3a4.html Albertsons's ditches loyalty cards], ''Dallas Morning News'', September 27, 2007. {{wayback|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/bus/industries/retail/stories/092707dnbusalbertsonscard.11053c3a4.html |date=20071017091317 }}</ref>

In 2008, New Albertsons divested Bristol Farms to its senior management.

===Sales and store closures===
In November 2006, [[Save Mart Supermarkets]] acquired Albertsons' Northern California and Northern Nevada locations and began operating the stores in February 2007.<ref name=savemart>[http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail/4441947-1.html Albertsons is sold in Northern California]{{Dead link|date=April 2015}} ''AllBusiness'', November 28, 2006.</ref> The company gradually converted all the stores to its Save Mart banner, except for stores in the San Francisco Bay area, which were rebranded as Lucky.<ref name=savemart/> Most of the Albertsons locations had originally been branded as Lucky before Albertson's 1999 purchase of [[American Stores]].<ref name=savemart/>

On June 12, 2007, Albertson's LLC agreed to acquire all [[Raleys]] locations in New Mexico. The acquisition includes one closed and eight operating stores in [[Albuquerque]] and one store in [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], thus doubling Albertsons store base in the Albuquerque region.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/06-12-2007/0004607088&EDATE= Albertson's LLC to Acquire Raley's New Mexico Stores], ''PR Newswire'', June 13, 2007.</ref> In December 2007, SuperValu acquired the eight remaining Wyoming locations from Albertson's LLC not already owned by the company.

On May 5, 2008, Albertson's LLC announced the sale and divestiture of all 72 of the Albertsons Express fuel centers to San Antonio, Texas-based [[Valero Energy Corporation]]. Most of the Albertsons Express stores were located in the Phoenix, Arizona; Denver, Colorado; Baton Rouge and Lafayette, Louisiana; and Dallas-Ft. Worth markets. The transaction was completed in August 2008. Valero converted the acquired locations into Valero Corner Stores.

In June 2008, Albertson's LLC entered into an agreement with [[Lakeland, Florida]]-based [[Publix]] stores to sell 49 Florida Albertsons locations to the chain. This included 15 stores in Northern and Northwest Florida, 30 locations in Central Florida, and four locations in South Florida. The sale was completed in September.<ref>[http://www.allbusiness.com/company-activities-management/company-structures-ownership/11407428-1.html Publix buying 49 Albertsons Stores], ''AllBusiness'', June 9, 2008 {{wayback|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/company-activities-management/company-structures-ownership/11407428-1.html |date=20100501060330 }}</ref> In July 2009, SuperValu announced that it was selling 36 of its 43 Utah Albertsons locations to [[Associated Food Stores]].<ref name=utah>[http://finance.yahoo.com/news/SUPERVALU-Announces-Sale-of-bw-4268398789.html?x=0&.v=1 SuperValu announces sale of Albertsons stores in Utah]{{Dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> All stores were rebranded as Fresh Market.<ref name=utah/>

On January 10, 2013, it was announced<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supervaluinvestors.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=93272&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1773238&highlight=|title=SUPERVALU Announces Definitive Agreement for Sale of Five Retail Grocery Banners to Cerberus-Led Investor Group|publisher=Supervalu|date=January 9, 2013|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}</ref> that Supervalu was selling New Albertsons (Albertsons and the ASC purchased stores) to [[Cerberus Capital Management]], which own the rest of the Albertsons stores. Since then, the Albertsons LLC-owned stores have come into the fold. In February 23, 2013, Albertsons LLC announced it would split operations of the combined chain into five divisions: Northwestern, Intermountain, Southern California, Southern, and Southwestern.

In June, the '''AlbertsonsMarket.com''' website and its [[Facebook]] page were merged into the '''Albertsons.com''' website and its Facebook page as part of the merger of the two companies. At the same time, the "It's a Great Deal" slogan adopted by Albertsons LLC/Albertsons Market since 2006 was replaced with "You're In for Something Fresh."

===Going public===
After several months of rumors, the combined operation announced it would go public as '''Albertsons Companies, Inc.''' Albertsons attempted to IPO with the ticker ABS on October 14, 2015, planning to raise as much as $1.7 billion, selling 65.3 million shares with a range of $23 - $26 per share. However, the company postponed the listing due to market conditions, particularly after Wal-Mart warned of more challenged sales earlier that day. Albertsons has reportedly postponed the IPO indefinitely, as of October 2015.<ref name="albertsons.com"/>

[[File:Albertsonslocationsmap.PNG|thumb|Albertsons-owned locations in various states]]
Prior to the merger with Safeway, Albertsons operated stores under the following banners:

*'''[[Acme Markets|ACME]]''' 178 locations ([[Connecticut|CT]], [[Delaware|DE]], [[Maryland|MD]], [[New Jersey|NJ]], [[New York|NY]] and [[Pennsylvania|PA]])  <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainlinemedianews.com/articles/2015/11/18/main_line_times/news/doc564632d0eb0e2022741059.txt|title=Three area SuperFresh stores become ACME markets this week|work=Mainline Media News|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref>

*'''[[Super Saver Foods]]''' 2 locations ([[Utah|UT]])
*'''[[United Supermarkets]]''' 37 locations ([[Texas|TX]])

On July 20, 2015, the company announced its plans to acquire 76 stores owned by [[A&P]] in 4 states, to be rebannered as ACME.  If this acquisition takes place, it would mean a return of the company to New York and Connecticut after absences of several years.

== Brands ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
Albertsons owns several store brands ("[[private label]]" brands), often bearing the name of the chain sold under, e.g. "Jewel" brand products in the Jewel and Jewel-Osco locations. Other Albertsons brands over the years have included ''Good Day'', ''Village Market'', ''A+'', ''Master's Choice'', and ''Janet Lee'' (named after the executive vice-president's daughter). The drug store brands (used for health and beauty aids, over-the-counter medications, and intimate paper goods) were consolidated under the name "Equaline," rather than the previous name, "Sav-On Osco by Albertsons" brand. Albertsons introduced an upscale private label brand, "Essensia," in 2003, which has now been renamed by SuperValu as Culinary Circle.  Store brand items in Albertsons stores include Albertsons (national brand quality food), Shoppers Value (value priced items), Homelife (national brand quality non-foods), Culinary Circle ("gourmet" foods and ready-made meals), Whole Care Pet (pet foods and supplies), Baby Basics (diapers and infant care items), Java Delight (coffee), Farm Fresh (fresh produce), Arctic Shores (frozen seafood), Stockman & Dakota (high-quality beef), Flavorite (national brand quality foods, used throughout Supervalu stores), Stone Ridge (ice cream and sherbet), Super Chill (soft drinks and mixers), Equaline (health and beauty products), and Wild Harvest (natural and organic foods). In 2011 SuperValu announced it would eliminate Flavorite and all brands named after the chains it operates (such as Albertsons, Jewel, Shaw's, etc.) and would replace those labels with a new label, Essential Everyday.

After its purchase of Safeway, Albertsons began replacing some of its brands with Safeway's. O Organics and Open Nature replaced Wild Harvest, Pantry Essentials replaced Shoppers Value while Refreshe replaced Super Chill. By late 2015, its remaining store brands will be replaced with "Signature" (formerly Safeway Kitchens, Home, Farms and Care).

== Technology ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}
Albertsons was increasingly progressive in the area of technology, having in recent years added a "check out while you go" system, known as "Shop 'N' Scan", where shoppers scanned items as they shopped and quickly paid before leaving. This was tested at Albertsons (now LLC) stores in Texas. This system has since been removed from some stores.<!-- Which recent months? Notable? At ALL of the stores? -->

Albertsons offered (in certain areas) its customers the option to shop from home via the company's website. Pickups were arranged at the store, or the items were delivered to the customer's home. In areas where this program was in effect, it was widely advertised over [[television advertising|television]] and [[radio advertising|radio]] by corporate [[spokesman|spokeswoman]] [[Patricia Heaton]].

At the beginning of 2009, SuperValu introduced a  way to help customers shop healthy known as nutrition iQ. This program identifies the health benefits of over 60,000 products in 11  different health categories.

On June 11, 2013 Albertsons announced its plans to merge its duplicate websites, social media accounts and mobile apps onto one of each kind.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.albertsons.com/2013/06/big-changes/ |title=Big Changes are Coming! |publisher=Albertsons |deadurl=yes |accessdate=June 26, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130629045313/http://www.albertsons.com:80/2013/06/big-changes/ |archivedate=June 29, 2013 }}</ref> While its website consolidation appeared to take place as expected, its applications received bad reviews<ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/albertsonsmkt/id542751329?mt=8 |title=AlbertsonsMkt for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad on the iTunes App Store |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref> — but the biggest consequence was the mistaken deletion of their previous Facebook page and loss of over 200,000 fans. While no details were given as to the mistake made, Albertsons simply admitted that while attempting to join their Albertsons page with over 200,000 Likes and their Albertsons Market page with over 80,000 Likes, something went wrong resulting in the loss of thousands of Likes and comments.

Since its acquisition of United Supermarkets, the '''Albertsons Market''' brand was revived, and its Facebook and Twitter pages were re-opened.

== Preferred Savings Card ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
Prior to the introduction of the Albertsons Preferred Savings Card in 2001 to all stores, Albertsons used a savings program called "Bonus Buys." "Bonus Buys" were available to anyone that shopped at Albertsons. Preferred Savings Cards are issued to all shoppers and allow for customers to actually see the savings. The cards were also used in a gas rewards program beginning in 2009. Only the SuperValu-owned Albertsons stores continued to use the Preferred Savings Cards, as the Albertsons LLC stores discontinued them after September 2007.  In June 2013, the use of the Preferred card in the former SuperValu stores was discontinued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albertsons.com/2013/06/card-free-savings/ |title=Albertsons Card Free Savings |publisher=Albertsons |date=June 2013 |accessdate=March 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130829054551/http://www.albertsons.com:80/2013/06/card-free-savings/ |archivedate=August 29, 2013 }}</ref> The cards briefly continued in Southern California stores before being discontinued in July 2013.
