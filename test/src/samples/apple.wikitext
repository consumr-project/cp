By the end of the 1970s, Apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line.

Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface ([[Graphical user interface|GUI]]), and development of a GUI began for the [[Apple Lisa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.worldofapple.com/archives/2006/03/30/apple-at-30-1976-to-1986/|title=Apple at 30&nbsp;– 1976 to 1986 | work=World of Apple|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}</ref> In 1982, however, he was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting. Jobs took over Jef Raskin's low-cost-computer project, the [[Macintosh]]. A race broke out between the Lisa team and the Macintosh team over which product would ship first. Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.<ref name="lemlisa">Hormby, Thomas.

The Macintosh initially sold well, but follow-up sales were not strong<ref name="lem1985">Hormby, Thomas. [http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/1002.html Good-bye Woz and Jobs: How the first Apple era ended in 1985], ''Low End Mac'', October 2, 2006. Retrieved March 2, 2007.</ref> due to its high price and limited range of software titles. The machine's fortunes changed with the introduction of the [[LaserWriter]], the first [[PostScript]] [[laser printer]] to be sold at a reasonable price, and [[Adobe PageMaker|PageMaker]], an early [[desktop publishing]] package. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/beginners/f/when_dtp.htm|title=When was desktop publishing invented?|accessdate=April 30, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070420204531/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/beginners/f/when_dtp.htm| archivedate= April 20, 2007| deadurl= no}}</ref> The Macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.

In 1985, a power struggle developed between Jobs and CEO [[John Sculley]], who had been hired two years earlier.<ref name="lemsculley">Hormby, Thomas. [http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/john-sculley-years-apple.html Growing Apple with the Macintosh: The Sculley years], ''Low End Mac'', February 22, 2006. Retrieved March 2, 2007.</ref> The Apple board of directors instructed Sculley to "contain" Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a [[Coup d'état#Other uses of the term|coup]] and called a board meeting at which Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties.<ref name="lem1985" /> Jobs resigned from Apple and founded [[NeXT|NeXT Inc.]] the same year.<ref>{{cite news| last = Spector| first = G| title = Apple's Jobs Starts New Firm, Targets Education Market| work = [[PC Week]]| page = 109| date = September 24, 1985}}</ref>

After Jobs' departure, the Macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points, the so-called "high-right policy" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a $1000 price for the Macintosh, which they were unable to meet. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher [[profit margin]], and appeared to have no effect on total sales as [[power user]]s snapped up every increase in power. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due to [[Jean-Louis Gassée]]'s mantra of "fifty-five or die", referring to the 55% [[profit margin]]s of the [[Macintosh II]].<ref>{{Cite book

This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on [[IBM PC compatible|PC clones]] that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points. The company lost its monopoly in this market, and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history that saw declining sales, and led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.<ref>{{Cite book

In 1991 Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]], replacing the "luggable" [[Macintosh Portable]] with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced [[System 7]], a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities.

The success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to cannibalization of their higher priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets. These were the high-end [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]]s, the mid-range [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] line, and the ill-fated [[Macintosh Performa|Performa]] series.

By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as [[A/UX]]. The Macintosh platform itself was becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking and because several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. In addition, Apple was facing competition from [[OS/2]] and [[UNIX]] vendors such as [[Sun Microsystems]]. The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html| title=1990–1995: Hitting the Wall|accessdate=August 14, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080924063130/http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html| archivedate= September 24, 2008| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 1994, Apple allied with [[IBM]] and [[Motorola]] in the [[AIM alliance]] with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the [[PowerPC Reference Platform]]), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter Microsoft. The same year, Apple introduced the [[Power Macintosh]], the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola's [[PowerPC]] processor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple-history.com/body.php?page=gallery&model=6100&performa=off&sort=date&order=ASC&range=|title=Power Macintosh 6100|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}</ref>

After years of speculation and multiple rumored "leaks", Apple announced a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and many iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, despite very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the US.

A patent filed in July 2013 revealed the development of a new iPhone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the user's habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly. Apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability of the iPhone to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used.<ref>{{cite web|title=Main Event Page gadgets Comment 1 inShare36 Apple Working On Location-Aware Battery Management For iPhone|url=http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/apple-working-on-location-aware-battery-management-for-iphone/?ncid=tcdaily|work=[[TechCrunch]]|publisher=[[AOL Inc]]|accessdate=July 25, 2013|author=Darrell Etherington|date=July 26, 2013}}</ref>

In a March 2014 interview, Apple designer [[Jonathan Ive]] used the iPhone as an example of Apple's ethos of creating high-quality, life-changing products. He explained that the phones are comparatively expensive due to the intensive effort that is used to make them:

{{quote|text=We don’t take so long and make the way we make for fiscal reasons ... Quite the reverse. The body is made from a single piece of machined aluminium ... The whole thing is polished first to a mirror finish and then is very finely textured, except for the Apple logo. The chamfers [smoothed-off edges] are cut with diamond-tipped cutters. The cutters don’t usually last very long, so we had to figure out a way of mass-manufacturing long-lasting ones. The camera cover is sapphire crystal. Look at the details around the sim-card slot.

At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the [[Apple TV]] (previously known as the iTV),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html |title=Apple Announces iTunes 7 with Amazing New Features |publisher=Apple.com |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40&nbsp;GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for [[HDMI]] and [[component video]], and played video at a maximum resolution of [[720p]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/01/09appletv.html |title= Apple TV Coming to Your Living Room |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate= October 7, 2011}}</ref> On May 31, 2007, a 160 GB drive was released alongside the existing 40&nbsp;GB model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30appletv.html |title=YouTube Coming to Apple TV |publisher=Apple.com |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> A software update released on January 15, 2008 allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15appletv.html |title=Apple Introduces New Apple TV Software & Lowers Price to $229 |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 15, 2008 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>

In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40 GB Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 GB Apple TV. On September 1, 2010, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV. The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of [[flash memory]] to [[cache (computing)|cache]] media downloaded. Like the iPad and the iPhone, Apple TV runs on an A4 processor. The memory included in the device is half of that in the [[iPhone 4]] at 256 MB; the same as the iPad, iPhone 3GS, third and fourth-generation [[iPod Touch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/apple-tv-teardown-reveals-8gb-flash-storage-256mb-ram/|first=Ross |last=Miller|title=Apple TV teardown reveals 8GB flash storage, 256MB RAM, leftover iPad parts|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010|publisher=AOL |work=[[Engadget]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101002001956/http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/apple-tv-teardown-reveals-8gb-flash-storage-256mb-ram/| archivedate= October 2, 2010| deadurl= no}}</ref>

It has HDMI out as the only video out source. Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including YouTube and Netflix, and media streaming from an iTunes library. Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99. A third generation of the device was introduced at an Apple event on March 7, 2012, with new features such as higher resolution (1080p) and a new user interface.

At the September 9, 2015 event, Apple unveiled an overhauled Apple TV, introducing the App Store and a new "[[Siri]] Remote" with a touchpad.

===Software===
{{See also|List of Macintosh software}}
[[File:WWDC 2011 Moscone West Exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] is held annually by Apple to showcase its new software and technologies for software developers.]]

Apple develops its own [[operating system]] to run on Macs, [[OS X]], the latest version being [[OS X El Capitan]] (version 10.11). Apple also independently develops computer software titles for its OS X operating system. Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers. An example of this is the consumer-oriented iLife software package that bundles [[iMovie]], [[iPhoto]] and [[GarageBand]]. For presentation, page layout and word processing, [[iWork]] is available, which includes [[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote]], [[Pages (iWork)|Pages]], and [[Numbers (software)|Numbers]]. iTunes, [[QuickTime]] media player, and [[Software Update]] are available as free downloads for both OS X and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

Apple also offers a range of professional software titles. Their range of server software includes the operating system [[OS X Server]]; [[Apple Remote Desktop]], a remote systems management application; and [[Xsan]], a [[Storage Area Network]] file system. For the professional creative market, there is [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] for professional [[Raw image format|RAW]]-format [[photo]] processing; [[Final Cut Pro]], a video production suite; [[Logic Pro]], a comprehensive music toolkit; and [[Motion (software)|Motion]], an advanced effects composition program.

Apple also offers online services with [[iCloud]], which provides cloud storage and syncing for a wide range of data, including email, contacts, calendars, photos and documents. It also offers iOS device backup, and is able to integrate directly with third-party apps for even greater functionality. iCloud is the fourth generation of online services provided by Apple, and was preceded by [[MobileMe]], .Mac and iTools, all which met varying degrees of success.

According to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a [[fruitarian]] diet. Jobs thought the name "Apple" was "fun, spirited and not intimidating".<ref>{{cite news|title=Steve Jobs bio says Apple CEO abhorred 'corrupt' execs|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/20/steve-jobs-bio.html|accessdate=October 21, 2011|newspaper=CBC News|date=October 20, 2011}}</ref>

Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts [[Sir Isaac Newton]] sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by [[Rob Janoff]]'s "rainbow Apple", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the "bitten" logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. However, Jobs insisted that the logo be colorized to humanize the company.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/09/60597|title=Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion | date=September 26, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zlok.net/blog/2009/03/29/i-invented-the-apple-logo/|title=ZLOK Logo Design Blog: I Invented&nbsp;... the Apple Logo}}</ref> The logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry.<ref name="creativebits_interview">{{cite web|url=http://creativebits.org/interview/interview_rob_janoff_designer_apple_logo|title= Interview with Rob Janoff, designer of the Apple logo|first=Ivan|last=Raszl}}</ref> The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color.<ref name="creativebits_interview" /> This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to [[Alan Turing]], with the bite mark a reference to [[Alan Turing#Death|his method of suicide]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html |title=Logos that became legends: Icons from the world of advertising |location=UK |work=The Independent |accessdate=September 14, 2009 | date=January 4, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091003003651/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html| archivedate= October 3, 2009| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unisourcedesign.ca/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html |title=Archived Interview with Rob Janoff |date=March 14, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20050314132032/http://www.unisourcedesign.ca:80/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html |archivedate=March 14, 2005 }}</ref> Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.<ref name="creativebits_interview"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Leavitt|first=David|title=The Man Who Knew Too Much; Alan Turing and the invention of the computer|year=2007|page=280|location=Phoenix|isbn=978-0-7538-2200-5}}</ref>

On August 27, 1999<ref name="web.archive.org"/> (the year following the introduction of the [[iMac G3]]), Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation.

==Corporate affairs==
{{see also|List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple|Braeburn Capital|FileMaker Inc.}}

===Corporate culture===
Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of [[corporate culture]]. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a [[Fortune 500]] company. By the time of the "1984" television commercial, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deutschman|first=Alan|title=The once and future Steve Jobs|url=http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/|work=Salon.com|accessdate=November 22, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101202183854/http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/| archivedate= December 2, 2010| deadurl= no}}</ref> According to a 2011 report in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]],'' this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.<ref name=Fortune1>{{cite news|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup|title=How Apple works: inside the world's largest startup|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|publisher=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=August 25, 2011}}</ref>

As the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned to the company. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often take longer than projects with it.<ref name="cultofmacwork">{{cite web|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/what-its-like-to-work-at-apple|title=What It's Like To Work At Apple|first=John|last=Brownlee|date=July 7, 2010}}</ref> To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [[personal computing]] while at the company.

At Apple, employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this as a means of having "best-in-class" employees in every role. For instance, [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]]—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores (this was done by Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management).<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news|last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/ |title=How Apple works: Inside the world's biggest startup – Fortune Tech |publisher=Tech.fortune.cnn.com |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1"/> Apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a "directly responsible individual," or "DRI" in Apple jargon.<ref name=Fortune1/> As an example, when iOS senior vice president [[Scott Forstall]] refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned [[Apple Maps|Maps app]], he was forced to resign.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|title=Inside Apple's major shakeup|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/10/29/inside-apples-major-shakeup/|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=October 29, 2012|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref> Unlike other major U.S. companies Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft.

===Customer service===
In 1999 Apple retained Eight Inc. as a strategic retail design partner and began creating the Apple retail stores. Tim Kobe of Eight Inc. prepared an "Apple Retail" white paper for Jobs, outlining the ability of separate Apple retail stores to directly drive the Apple brand experience—Kobe used their recently completed work with The North Face and Nike as a basis for the white paper.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The first two Apple Stores opened on May 19, 2001 in Tysons Corner, Virginia, and [[Glendale, California]]. More than 7,700 people visited Apple’s first two stores in the opening weekend, spending a total of US$599,000.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Benj Edwards|title=A tale of two Apple Stores (the first two)|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1159817/first2applestores.html|website=MacWorld|publisher=IDG Consumer & SMB|accessdate=September 14, 2014|date=May 19, 2011}}</ref> {{As of|2014|06}}, Apple maintains 425 [[Apple Store|retail stores]] in fourteen countries.<ref name = "AppleRetailStoreList">{{cite web | url = //www.apple.com/retail/storelist/ | title = Apple Retail Store – Store List | accessdate =June 9, 2014 | publisher = Apple Inc.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/07/23Apple-Reports-Third-Quarter-Results.html|title=Apple – Press Info – Apple Reports Third Quarter Results|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}</ref> In addition to Apple products, the stores sell third-party products like software titles, digital cameras, camcorders and handheld organizers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/may/20retail.html |title=Apple Marks Second Anniversary of Retail Stores |publisher=Apple.com |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>

A media article published in July 2013 provided details about Apple's "At-Home Apple Advisors" customer support program that serves as the corporation's call center. The advisors are employed within the U.S. and work remotely after undergoing a four-week training program and testing period. The advisors earn between US$9 and $12 per hour and receive intensive management to ensure a high quality of customer support.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Apple Gets At-Home Workers To Work|url=http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/28/how-apple-gets-at-home-workers-to-work/?ncid=tcdaily|work=TechCrunch|publisher=AOL Inc|accessdate=July 29, 2013|author=Ashley Verrill|date=July 28, 2013}}</ref>

===Manufacturing===
The company's manufacturing, procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: “Nobody wants to buy sour milk”.<ref name=supply/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/11/09/ruthlessness-and-lasers-apples-supply-chain-revealed/ |title=Ruthlessness and lasers: Apple's supply chain revealed &#124; Smart Shift &#124; Executive &#124; Financial Post |publisher=Business.financialpost.com |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}</ref>

During the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawlor.cs.uaf.edu/~olawlor/ref/mac_ports/index.html |title=Mac Ports |publisher=Lawlor.cs.uaf.edu |date=March 17, 2001 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus in the [[Power Macintosh 7500|7500]]/[[Power Macintosh 8500|8500]]/[[Power Macintosh 9500|9500]] [[Power Macintosh|Power Macs]]. Apple has since adopted (and often co-developed) industry standards such as [[USB]], [[AGP]], [[HyperTransport]], [[Wi-Fi]], and others in its products. [[FireWire]] is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as [[IEEE 1394]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html |title=1394 Trade Association: What is 1394? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140404152533/http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html |archivedate=April 4, 2014 }}</ref>

====Labor practices====
{{further|Criticism of Apple Inc.#Labor practices}}
The company advertised its products as being made in America until the late 1990s; however, as a result of [[outsourcing]] initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by the ''[[New York Times]]'', Apple insiders "believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that “Made in the U.S.A.” is no longer a viable option for most Apple products".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first1=Charles | last1=Duhigg | first2=Keith | last2=Bradsher | title=Apple, America and a Squeezed Middle Class | date=January 21, 2012}}</ref>

The statement was released after the results from the company's probe into its suppliers' labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple's own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories.<ref name="Huff" /> Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.<ref name="Fire" />

In 2013, [[China Labor Watch]] said it found violations of the law and of Apple's working condition pledges at facilities operated by [[Pegatron]]. These violations included discrimination against ethnic minorities and women, withholding of employee pay, excessive work hours, poor living conditions, health and safety problems and pollution.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/29/apple-supplier-accused-of-labor-abuses_n_3669526.html?ncid=txtlnkushpmg00000029 Apple Supplier Accused Of Labor Abuses By China Watchdog (VIDEO)] ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.

A 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since 2010, Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: “We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions".<ref name="Fire">{{cite news|title=Apple under fire again for working conditions at Chinese factories|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/19/apple-under-fire-again-for-working-conditions-at-chinese-factories?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2|accessdate=December 20, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=December 19, 2014}}</ref>

In December 2014, the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65 hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in "primitive, dark and filthy dorms" where they sleep "on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room." Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.<ref>Dave Jamieson (December 23, 2014).

The suit alleged illegal and improper wage practices in violation of the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] that deprived staff of wages they should have earned during what they contended was compensable time at "work". On November 7, 2015, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] issued an order granting Apple’s Motion for Summary Judgment dismissing each and every claim brought against Apple by the employees in this case.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bahmani|first1=Shar|title=How Do You Like Them Apples?

In 2010, [[Climate Counts]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category "Striding".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecounts.org/scorecard_score.php?co=7 |title=Climate Counts scorecard |publisher=Climatecounts.org |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a "stuck icon", adding that Apple at the time was "a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer".<ref name="iwclimate">{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/mac/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207601672|title=Environmental Group Hits Apple}}</ref>

In November 2011, Apple featured in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how "green" their products are.

It continues to score well on the products rating with all Apple products now being free of PVC vinyl plastic and brominated flame retardants. However, the guide criticizes Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data and for not setting out any targets to reduce emissions.<ref name="Guide to Greener Electronics" /> In January 2012, Apple requested that their cable maker, Volex, begin producing halogen-free USB and power cables.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Ash|title=Apple Power Cables to Become Even More Environmentally Friendly|url=http://www.keynoodle.com/apple-power-cables-to-become-even-more-environmentally-friendly/|publisher=KeyNoodle|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}</ref>

Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[British Virgin Islands]] to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to ''The New York Times,'' in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the "[[Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich]]," which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Duhigg|first1=Charles|last2=Kocieniewski|first2=David|title=How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 29, 2012|location=Reno, Nevada|date=April 28, 2012}}</ref>

[[British Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament [[Charlie Elphicke]] published research on October 30, 2012,<ref>{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Roland|title=Foreign companies 'avoid billions in corporation tax'|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3583772.ece|newspaper=The Times|date=October 30, 2012}}</ref> which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard [[corporation tax]]. He followed this research by calling on the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] to force these multinationals, which also included [[Google]] and [[The Coca-Cola Company]], to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebrahimi|first=Helia|title=Foreign firms could owe UK £11bn in unpaid taxes|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/tax/9652516/Foreign-firms-could-owe-UK-11bn-in-unpaid-taxes.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=November 2, 2012|location=London}}</ref> In June 2014 the [[European Commissioner for Competition]] launched an investigation of Apple's tax practices in [[Ireland]], as part of a wider probe of multi-national companies' tax arrangements in various European countries.<ref name="ECprobe">{{cite news|title=European Commission to probe tax affairs of Apple, Starbucks and Fiat|url=http://www.europesun.com/index.php/sid/222816605/scat/baf10b3527f6df38/ht/European-Commission-to-probe-tax-affairs-of-Apple-Starbucks-and-Fiat|accessdate=June 12, 2014|publisher=Europe Sun}}</ref>

In 2015 [[Reuters]] reported that Apple had earnings abroad of $54.4 billion which were untaxed by the [[IRS]]. Under U.S. law corporations don't pay income tax on overseas profits until the profits are brought into the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Drawbaugh|first1=Kevin|last2=Temple-West|first2=Patrick|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/09/us-usa-tax-offshore-idUSBREA3729V20140409|title=Untaxed U.S. corporate profits held overseas top $2.1 trillion: study|work=Reuters|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}</ref>

===Litigation===
{{main|Apple Inc. litigation}}
Apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Court Cases Involving Apple, Inc.|url=https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/AllNaturesOfSuit/Apple%2C%20Inc./|publisher=Docket Alarm, Inc.|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref> In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include ''[[Apple v. Samsung]]'', ''[[Apple v. Microsoft]]'', ''[[Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.]]'', and ''[[Apple Corps v. Apple Computer]]''. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges of violating other’s intellectual property rights.  In October 2015, for example, a jury found that Apple had infringed a [[University of Wisconsin]] patent on microprocessor technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=03300001Y8H0|title=Apple Loses University of Wisconsin Patent Lawsuit, Faces $862M Fine – NewsFactor Network|work=newsfactor.com|accessdate=October 22, 2015}}</ref>
