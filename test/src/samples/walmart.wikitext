The company was listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in 1972. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the company rose from a regional to a national giant.

Walmart's investments outside North America have seen mixed results: its operations in the [[United Kingdom]], [[South America]], and [[China]] are highly successful, whereas ventures in [[Germany]] and [[South Korea]] failed.

Walmart's reputation is for "low prices", compared with [[Target Corporation|Target]]'s for selling "cheap chic" and [[Costco]]'s for offering low-price, limited-selection "retail treasure hunts", where "one's shopping cart could contain a $50,000 diamond ring resting on top of a 64-ounce vat of mayonnaise".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/10/30/8391725/index.htm?postversion=2006102506|title= Why Costco is so addictive: A day with Jim Sinegal, the Merchandising Maestro who gets shoppers to buy 2,250-count packs of Q-Tips and mayo by the drum|work=Fortune|author=Boyle, Matthew|date=October 25, 2006 }}</ref>

{{Main|History of Walmart}}

===Early years (1945–1969)===

[[File:09-02-06-OriginalWaltons.jpg|thumb|right|Sam Walton's original Walton's Five and Dime store in [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], [[Arkansas]] now serving as the Walmart Visitor Center]]

In 1945, a businessman and former [[J. C. Penney]] employee, [[Sam Walton]], purchased a branch of the [[Ben Franklin Stores]] from the [[Butler Brothers]].<ref name="madeinamerica">{{cite book|author=Walton, Sam; Huey, John|title=''Sam Walton: Made in America: My Story''|place=[[New York]]|publisher=[[Bantam Books|Bantam]]|year=1993|isbn=978-0-553-56283-5}}</ref> His primary focus was on selling products at low prices to get higher-volume sales at a lower [[profit margin]], portraying it as a crusade for the consumer. He experienced setbacks, because the lease price and branch purchase were unusually high, but he was able to find lower-cost suppliers than those used by other stores. He passed on the savings in the product pricing.<ref name="a">{{cite web|url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/2375.html|title=Sam Walton: Great From the Start – HBS Working Knowledge|author=Richard S.

Within the fifth year, the store was generating $250,000 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|250000|1949|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in revenue. When the lease for the location expired, Walton was unable to reach an agreement for renewal, so he opened a new store at 105 N.

On July 2, 1962, Walton opened the first Walmart Discount City store at 719 W. Walnut Street in [[Rogers, Arkansas]].

===Incorporation and growth as a regional power (1969–1990)===
The company was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] as '''Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.''' on October 31, 1969. In 1970, it opened its home office and first distribution center in [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], [[Arkansas]]. It had 38 stores operating with 1,500 employees and sales of $44.2&nbsp;million. It began trading stock as a [[Public company|publicly held company]] on October 1, 1970, and was soon listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. The first [[stock split]] occurred in May 1971 at a price of $47 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|47|1971|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}). By this time, Walmart was operating in five states: Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma; it entered Tennessee in 1973 and Kentucky and Mississippi in 1974. As it moved into Texas in 1975, there were 125 stores with 7,500 employees and total sales of $340.3&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|340300000|1975|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).<ref name="timeline" /> Walmart opened its first Texas store in [[Mount Pleasant, Texas|Mount Pleasant]] on November 11, 1975.<ref name="Halkias">{{cite news|author=Halkias, Maria|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10D9531DE09EB928&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D|title=Living with Walmart 30 years later, Texas both cheers and fears discount behemoth Lone Star State has been changed, as has giant retailer|work= [[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=October 30, 2005|accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref>

In the 1980s, Walmart continued to grow rapidly, and by its 25th anniversary in 1987, there were 1,198 stores with sales of $15.9&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|15900000000|1987|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) and 200,000 associates.<ref name="timeline" /> This year also marked the completion of the company's satellite network, a $24&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|24000000|1987|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) investment linking all operating units with the Bentonville office via two-way voice and data transmission and one-way video communication.

===Retail rise to multinational status (1990–2005)===

By 1988, Walmart was more profitable than rivals [[Kmart]] and [[Sears]] and was the dominant retailer in the [[Bible Belt]]; by 1990, it outsold both in terms of revenue and became the largest U.S. retailer by revenue.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Prior to the summer of 1990, Walmart had no presence on the West Coast or in the Northeast (except for a single Sam's Club in New Jersey which opened in November 1989), but in July and October that year, it opened its first stores in [[California]] and [[Pennsylvania]], respectively. By the mid-1990s, it was far and away the most powerful retailer in the U.S. and expanded into Mexico in 1991 and Canada in 1994.<ref>Jacques, Peter. (January 1, 1970) [http://www.academia.edu/169368/Wal-Mart_or_World-Mart_A_Teaching_Case_Study Wal-Mart or World-Mart? A Teaching Case Study | Peter Jacques]. Academia.edu.

As Walmart rapidly expanded into the world's largest corporation, many critics worried about its effect on local communities, particularly small towns with many "[[Small business|mom and pop]]" stores. There have been several studies on the economic impact of Walmart on small towns and local businesses, jobs, and taxpayers. In one, Kenneth Stone, a Professor of Economics at [[Iowa State University]], found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Walmart store opening.<ref name="Rural">Stone, Kenneth E. (1997). "[http://www.econ.iastate.edu/faculty/stone/10yrstudy.pdf Impact of the Wal-Mart Phenomenon on Rural Communities]".

In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in September 2005, Walmart used its logistics network to organize a rapid response to the disaster, donating $20&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|20000000|2005|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in cash, 1,500 truckloads of merchandise, food for 100,000 meals, as well as the promise of a job for every one of its displaced workers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/05/AR2005090501598.html|title=Wal-Mart at Forefront of Hurricane Relief|date=September 6, 2005|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=March 10, 2009|author=Barbaro, Michael; Gillis, Justin}}</ref> An independent study by Steven Horwitz of [[St. Lawrence University]] found that Walmart, [[The Home Depot]], and [[Lowe's]] made use of their local knowledge about supply chains, infrastructure, decision makers and other resources to provide emergency supplies and reopen stores well before FEMA began its response.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Insurance/InsureYourHome/RealKatrinaHeroWalMartStudySays.aspx|title=Real Katrina hero?

===Initiatives (2005–2010)===
In October 2005, Walmart announced several environmental measures to increase [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. The primary goals included spending $500&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|500000000|2005|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) a year to increase fuel efficiency in Walmart's truck fleet by 25 percent over three years and double it within ten, reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions by 20 percent in seven years, reduce energy use at stores by 30 percent, and cut solid waste from U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs by 25 percent in three years. CEO Lee Scott said that Walmart's goal was to be a "good steward for the environment" and ultimately use only [[renewable energy]] sources and produce zero waste.<ref name="going_green">{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9815727/|title=Is Wal-Mart Going Green?|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=October 25, 2005|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}</ref> The company also designed three new experimental stores with [[wind turbine]]s, [[photovoltaic]] solar panels, [[biofuel]]-capable boilers, water-cooled refrigerators, and [[xeriscaping|xeriscape]] gardens.<ref>{{cite news|author=Berner, Robert|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/sep2005/nf20050922_6448_db016.htm|title=Can Wal-Mart Wear a White Hat?|work=BusinessWeek|date=September 22, 2005|accessdate=July 24, 2006}}</ref> Despite much criticism of its environmental record, Walmart took a few steps in what some viewed as a positive direction, which included becoming the biggest seller of organic milk and the biggest buyer of organic cotton in the world, as well as reducing packaging and energy costs.<ref name="GuntherMark">{{cite news|author=Gunther, Mark|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/07/25/news/companies/wal-mart-short.fortune/|title=Wal-Mart sees green|publisher=CNN|date=July 27, 2006|accessdate=November 8, 2007 |archive-url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20060822072035/http://money.cnn.com/2006/07/25/news/companies/wal-mart-short.fortune/|archive-date=August 22, 2006}}</ref> Walmart also spent nearly a year working with outside consultants to discover the company's total environmental impact and find areas for improvement. Walmart has also recently created its own [[electric power industry|electric company]] in Texas, ''Texas Retail Energy'', and plans to supply its stores with cheap power purchased at wholesale prices. Through this new venture, the company expects to save $15&nbsp;million annually and also to lay the groundwork and infrastructure to sell electricity to Texas consumers in the future.<ref name="redorbit_electricity">{{cite web|author=Souder, Elizabeth|url= http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/817594/will_walmart_sell_electricity_one_day/index.html|title=Will Wal-Mart Sell Electricity One Day?|publisher=RedOrbit|date=January 28, 2007|accessdate=March 31, 2008}}</ref>

In March 2006, Walmart sought to appeal to a more affluent demographic. The company launched a new Supercenter concept in [[Plano, Texas]], intended to compete against stores seen as more upscale and appealing, such as [[Target Corporation|Target]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Koenig, David|title=Wal-Mart Targeting Upscale Shoppers|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=March 22, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11957536/|title=Wal-Mart turns attention to upscale shoppers|publisher=MSNBC|date=March 23, 2006|accessdate=December 1, 2007}}</ref> The new store has wood floors, wider aisles, a [[sushi]] bar, a coffee/sandwich shop with free [[Wi-Fi]] Internet access, and more expensive beers, wines, electronics, and other goods. The exterior has a hunter green background behind the Walmart letters, similar to Neighborhood Market by Walmarts, instead of the blue previously used at its supercenters.

On September 12, 2007, Walmart introduced new advertising with the [[slogan]], "''Save money. Live better.''", replacing "''Always Low Prices, Always''", which it had used for the previous 19 years. [[Global Insight]], which conducted the research that supported the ads, found that Walmart's [[price level]] reduction resulted in savings for consumers of $287&nbsp;billion in 2006 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|287000000000|2006|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}), which equated to $957 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|957|2006|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) per person or $2,500 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|2500|2006|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) per household (up 7.3 percent from the 2004 savings estimate of $2,329 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|2329|2004|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}})).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/12/us-walmart-advertising-idUSWEN091820070912|title=Wal-Mart rolling out new company slogan|publisher=Reuters|date= September 12, 2007|accessdate=December 7, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CkWuovb7|archivedate=December 7, 2012}}</ref>

On June 30, 2008, Walmart removed the hyphen from its logo and replaced the star with a symbol that resembles a sunburst, flower, or the star in the [[star of life]]. The new logo received mixed reviews from design critics, who questioned whether the new logo was as bold as those of competitors, such as the [[Target Corporation|Target]] bullseye or as instantly recognizable as the previous company logo, which was used for 18 years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Armin|title=Less Hyphen, More Burst for Walmart |url=http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/less_hyphen_more_burst_for_wal.php |work=Brand New|publisher=UnderConsideration LLC|accessdate=August 9, 2010|date=June 30, 2008}}</ref> The new logo made its debut on the company's website on July 1, 2008.

===Current developments (2011–present)===
In January 2011 Walmart announced a program to improve the nutritional value of its store brands over five years, gradually reducing the amount of salt and sugar, and eliminating [[trans fat]]. Walmart also promised to negotiate with suppliers with respect to nutritional issues. Reductions in the prices of whole foods and vegetables were also promised as well as efforts to open stores in low-income areas, "[[food desert]]s", where there are no supermarkets.<ref>{{cite news|title=Walmart Shifts Strategy to Promote Healthy Foods|author=Sheryl Gay Stolberg|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/20/business/20walmart.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 20, 2011|accessdate=January 19, 2011}}</ref>

On April 23, 2011, the company announced that it was testing its new "Walmart To Go" home delivery system where customers will be able to order specific items offered on their website.

====Walmart Supercenter====
[[File:Remodeled Walmart.jpg|thumb|right|A remodeled Walmart Supercenter in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]]. ]]
'''Walmart Supercenters''', branded as simply "Walmart", are [[hypermarket]]s with size varying from {{convert|69000|to|261000|sqft|m2|1}}, with an average of about {{convert|182000|sqft|m2|1}}.<ref name="annrep" /> These stock everything a Walmart discount store does, but also include a full-service supermarket, including meat and poultry, [[baking|baked goods]], [[delicatessen]], [[frozen food]]s, dairy products, garden [[produce]], and fresh seafood. Many Walmart Supercenters also have a garden center, [[pet store|pet shop]], [[pharmacy]], Tire & [[Oil change|Lube]] Express, optical center, one-hour photo processing lab, portrait studio, and numerous alcove shops, such as cellular phone stores, hair and nail salons, video rental stores, local bank branches (newer locations have [[Woodforest National Bank]] branches), and fast food outlets, usually [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] but sometimes [[Dunkin Donuts]], [[McDonald's]], [[Wendy's]], [[Checkers (fast food)|Checker's]], [[Burger King]], [[Tim Horton's]] or [[Blimpie]]. Many often featured [[McDonald's]] stores, but in 2007, Walmart announced it would stop opening McDonald's restaurants at most of their newer stores. Most locations that opened up after the announcement had Subway as their restaurant. Some McDonald's inside the stores were even replaced with [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/09/13/walmart-dumps-mcdonalds-f_n_64322.html| work=Huffington Post | first=Michelle | last=Kung | title=Walmart Dumps McDonald's For Subway As In-Store Restaurateur | date=September 13, 2007}}</ref> And in some Canadian locations a [[Tim Horton's]] was opened. However, it was announced in November 2015 that beginning in January, all in-store outlets will be converted exclusively to [[Corner Bakery Café]] and the transition will be completed sometime by August 2016. Some also sell gasoline distributed by [[Murphy Oil|Murphy Oil Corporation]] (whose Walmart stations are branded as "Murphy USA"), [[Sunoco, Inc.]] ("Optima"), or [[Tesoro|Tesoro Corporation]] ("Mirastar").<ref name="CSNews_WMGas" />

The first Supercenter opened in 1988, in [[Washington, Missouri]]. A similar concept, ''[[Hypermart USA]]'', had opened in [[Garland, Texas]] a year earlier. All Hypermart USA stores were later closed or converted into Supercenters.

{{As of|2015|12|31|df=us}}, there were 3,467 Walmart Supercenters in the United States.<ref name="Walmart Corporate - United States">{{cite web|url=http://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/our-locations#/united-states|title=Walmart Corporate - United States|date=January 21, 2016}}</ref> The largest Supercenter in the United States, covering {{convert|260000|sqft|m2|1}} and two floors, is located in [[Crossgates Commons]] in [[Albany, New York]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.albany.com/news/walmart.cfm|title=Largest Walmart Supercenter In US Finds Home In Albany NY|publisher=Albany.com|accessdate= December 23, 2008}}</ref>

The "Supercenter" portion of the name has since been phased out, simply referring to these stores as "Walmart", since the company introduced the new Walmart logo in 2008.

In 1990, Walmart opened its first ''Bud's Discount City'' location in Bentonville. Bud's operated as a closeout store, much like [[Big Lots]].

====Walmart Express====
'''Walmart Express''' was a chain of smaller discount stores, with a range of services, from groceries to check cashing and gasoline service. The concept was focused on small towns not able to support a larger store, and in large cities where space is at a premium.

Walmart planned to build 15 to 20 Walmart Express stores, focusing on Arkansas, North Carolina and Chicago, by the end of its fiscal year in January 2012.

As of September 8, 2014 Walmart re-branded all of its Express format stores to Neighborhood Markets in an effort to streamline its retail offer. It continued to open new Express stores under the Neighborhood Market name.

{{As of|2015|12|31|df=us}}, there were 41 small format stores in the United States. These include Amigo, Walmart on Campus, and Super Ahorros stores.<ref name="Walmart Corporate - United States"/>

As of January 15, 2016, Walmart announced that it will be closing 269 stores globally, including all 102 U.S. Walmart Express stores.<ref>[http://www.wsj.com/articles/wal-mart-to-close-269-stores-globally-1452868122?mod=e2fb Wal-Mart Makes Rare Retreat on Home Turf - WSJ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

====Initiatives====
In September 2006, Walmart announced a pilot program to sell [[generic drug]]s at $4 per prescription. The program was launched at stores in the [[Tampa, Florida]] area, and expanded to all stores in Florida by January 2007. While the average price of generics is $29 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|29|2006|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) per prescription, compared to $102 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|102|2006|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) for name-brand drugs, Walmart maintains that it is not selling at a loss, or providing as an act of charity&nbsp;– instead, they are using the same mechanisms of mass distribution that it uses to bring lower prices to other products.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6119292|title=Walmart to Sell Generic Drugs for $4|last=Silberner|first=Joanne|date=September 21, 2006|publisher=[[All Things Considered]] ([[NPR]])|accessdate=March 10, 2009}}</ref> Many of Walmart's low cost generics are imported from India and made by drug makers in the country, including [[Ranbaxy Laboratories|Ranbaxy]] and [[Cipla]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=326184 |title=Pharma firms boost Walmart revenues |publisher=''[[Business Standard]]'' |date=June 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130513005859/http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=326184 |archivedate=May 13, 2013 }}</ref>

From 2008 through 2011, Walmart operated a pilot program in the small grocery store concept called ''Marketside'' in the metropolitan [[Phoenix, Arizona]] area.

In 2015, Walmart began testing a free grocery pickup service, allowing customers to select products online and choose their pickup time. At the store, a Walmart employee loads the groceries into the customer's car. As of September 2015, the program has expanded to 13 U.S. cities, and the company expects more stores to begin offering this service.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Garcia|first1=Tonya|title=Wal-Mart expands grocery pickup service to 8 more cities|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wal-mart-expands-its-grocery-pickup-service-to-8-more-cities-2015-09-29|website=marketwatch.com|publisher=MarketWatch|accessdate=September 29, 2015}}</ref>

The German market at this point was an oligopoly with high competition among companies which used a similar low price strategy as Walmart. As a result, Walmart's low price strategy yielded no competitive advantage. Also Walmart's [[Organizational culture|corporate culture]] was not viewed positively among employees and customers, particularly Walmart's "statement of ethics", which restricted relationships between employees and led to a public discussion in the media, resulting in a bad reputation among customers.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.stern.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/549609.html|title=Auch Walmart-Mitarbeiter dürfen lieben|work=[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]|date=November 15, 2005|language=German}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welt.de/print-welt/article177942/Walmart-Mitarbeiter_duerfen_flirten.html|title=Walmart-Mitarbeiter dürfen flirten|language= German|publisher=''[[Die Welt]]''|date=November 15, 2005}}</ref>

====Corruption charges====
An April 2012 investigative report by ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a former executive of Walmart de Mexico alleged that, in September 2005, the company had paid [[bribery|bribes]] via local fixers to officials throughout Mexico in exchange for construction permits, information, and other favors, which gave Walmart a substantial advantage over competitors.<ref name="NYTBribe">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/business/at-Walmart-in-mexico-a-bribe-inquiry-silenced.html |title=Vast Mexican Bribery Case Hushed Up by Walmart After High-Level Struggle |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|author=David Barstow |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}</ref> Walmart investigators found credible evidence that Mexican and American laws had been broken. Concerns were also raised that Walmart executives in the United States "hushed up" the allegations. A follow-up investigation by ''The New York Times,'' published December 17, 2012, revealed evidence that regulatory permission for siting, construction, and operation of nineteen stores had been obtained through bribery. There was evidence that a bribe of $52,000 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|52000|2004|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) was paid to change a zoning map, which enabled the opening of a Walmart store a mile from a historical site in [[San Juan Teotihuacán]] in 2004.<ref name="NYT92904">{{cite news|title=No, the Conquistadors Are Not Back.

===Sam's Club===
{{Main|Sam's Club}}
[[File:Sam's Club store.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Sam's Club store in [[Maplewood, Missouri]]]]

'''Sam's Club''' is a chain of [[warehouse club]]s that sell groceries and [[general merchandise]], often in bulk. Sam's Club stores are "membership" stores where most customers buy annual memberships. There are three kinds of memberships of Sam's Club: Sam's Plus, Sam's Business and Sam's Savings. Each of these memberships provides customers various benefits and convenience.<ref name="Sams Club Membership Benefits">{{cite web|url=http://www.dotcomol.com/2013/05/www-samsclub-com-sams-club-membership.html |title=Dotcomol |publisher=www.dotcomol.com |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> However, non-members can make purchases either by buying a one-day membership or paying a surcharge based on the price of the purchase.<ref name="aboutsamsclub">{{cite web|url=http://pressroom.samsclub.com/content/?id=3&atg=524|title=About Sam's Club|publisher=Sam's Club|accessdate=November 1, 2007}}</ref> Some locations also sell gasoline.<ref name="CSNews_WMGas" /> The first Sam's Club opened in 1983 in [[Midwest City, Oklahoma]]<ref name="aboutsamsclub" /> under the name "Sam's Wholesale Club".

Sam's Club has found a niche market in recent years as a supplier to small businesses. All Sam's Club stores are open early hours exclusively for business members and their old slogan was "We're in Business for Small Business." Their slogan has been "Savings Made Simple" since late 2009, as Sam's Club attempts to attract a more diverse member base.<ref name="aboutsamsclub" /> In March 2009, the company announced that it plans to enter the [[electronic medical record]]s business by offering a software package to physicians in small practices for $25,000. Walmart is partnering with [[Dell]] and eClinicalWorks.com in this new venture.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/business/11record.html|title=Walmart Plans to Market Digital Health Records System|last=Lohr|first=Steve|date=March 10, 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 11, 2009}}</ref>

Sam's Club's sales were $47&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|47000000000|2010|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}), or 11.5 percent of total Walmart sales, during fiscal 2010.<ref name="annrep" /> {{As of|2015|12|31|df=us}}, there were 655 Sam's Clubs in the United States, including Puerto Rico.<ref name="Walmart Corporate - Locations" /> Walmart also operates 199 international Sam's Clubs, including 160 in Mexico,<ref name="Walmart Corporate - Mexico"/> 27 in [[Brazil]],<ref name="Walmart Corporate - Brazil"/> and 12 in China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/our-locations#/china|title=Walmart Corporate - China|date=January 21, 2016}}</ref>

===Vudu===
In February 2010, Walmart agreed to buy [[Vudu]], a Silicon Valley start-up whose three-year-old online movie service is being built into an increasing number of televisions and Blu-ray players.

===Private label brands===
{{Main|List of Walmart brands}}
About 40 percent of products sold in Walmart are [[private label]] [[store brand]]s, which are produced for the company through contracts with manufacturers. Walmart began offering private label brands in 1991, with the launch of [[Sam's Choice]], a line of drinks produced by [[Cott|Cott Beverages]] for Walmart. Sam's Choice quickly became popular and by 1993, was the third most popular beverage brand in the United States.<ref name="samschoice">{{cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_n19_v32/ai_14495621|title=Sam's Choice Climbs Beverage Brand List – Walmart's Sam's American Choice Beverage Brand|work=Discount Store News|date=October 4, 1993|accessdate=April 20, 2007}}</ref> Other Walmart brands include Great Value and Equate in the U.S. and Canada and [[Asda|Smart Price]] in Britain.

[[File:Walmart Home Office sign.jpg|thumb|upright|Walmart Home Office in [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], [[Arkansas]].]]
Walmart is headquartered in the Walmart Home Office complex in [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], [[Arkansas]]. The company's [[business model]] is based on selling a wide variety of general merchandise at low prices.<ref name="annrep" /> The company refers to employees as "associates". All Walmart stores in the U.S. and Canada also have designated "greeters" at the entrance, a practice pioneered by [[Sam Walton]] and later imitated by other retailers. Greeters are trained to help shoppers find what they want and answer their questions.<ref name="Kendall_Gerald_I">{{cite book|last=Kendall|first=Gerald I.|title=Securing the future: strategies for exponential growth using the theory of constraints.|year=1998|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=1-57444-197-3|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KgjTUtVixroC&pg=PA106&dq=walmart+greeter#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

For many years, associates were identified in the store by their signature blue vest, but this practice was discontinued in June 2007 and replaced with khaki pants and polo shirts.

===Competition===
In North America, Walmart's primary competitors include [[department store]]s like [[Kmart]], [[Publix]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[ShopKo]] and [[Meijer]], Canada's The [[Real Canadian Superstore]] and [[Giant Tiger]], and Mexico's [[Comercial Mexicana]] and [[Soriana]]. Competitors of Walmart's Sam's Club division are [[Costco]] and the smaller [[BJ's Wholesale Club]] chain.

Walmart struggled to export its brand elsewhere as it rigidly tried to reproduce its model overseas. In China, Walmart hopes to succeed by adapting and doing things preferable to Chinese citizens. For example, it found that Chinese consumers preferred to select their own live fish and seafood; stores began displaying the meat uncovered and installed fish tanks, leading to higher sales.<ref name="China_reinvent">{{cite web|url=http://www.industryleadersmagazine.com/walmart-low-prices-big-numbers/|title= Walmart: Low Prices, Big Numbers|publisher=IndustryLeaders|accessdate=December 16, 2012|author=Ann, Carrie|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CwmGVwgZ|archivedate= December 16, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Economic impact===
Kenneth Stone, Professor of Economics at [[Iowa State University]], in a paper published in ''Farm Foundation'' in 1997, found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Walmart store opening.<ref name="Rural" /> He compared the changes to previous competitors small town shops have faced in the past{{snds}}from the development of the railroads and the Sears Roebuck catalog to shopping malls. He concludes that small towns are more affected by "discount mass merchandiser stores" than larger towns and that shop owners who adapt to the ever changing retail market can "co-exist and even thrive in this type of environment."<ref name="Rural" />

===Big data analytics===
As the largest retailer in the U.S., Walmart collects and analyzes a large amount of consumer data. The [[big data]] sets are [[Data mining|mined]] for use in [[predictive analytics]], which allow the company to optimize operations by predicting customer's habits.

In April 2011, Walmart acquired [[Kosmix]] to develop software for analyzing real-time data streams. In August 2012, Walmart announced its Polaris search engine.

The amount of data gathered by Walmart has raised privacy concerns.<ref name="nyt1">{{cite news|last=HAYS|first=CONSTANCE L.|title=What Wal-Mart Knows About Customers' Habits|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/business/yourmoney/14wal.html|accessdate=November 27, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 14, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A CASE STUDY OF WALMART|url=http://centerformediajustice.org/wp-content/files/WALMART_PRIVACY_MR.pdf|publisher=[[Center for Media Justice]]|accessdate=November 27, 2013|date=November 2013|archive-url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20131203005506/http://centerformediajustice.org/wp-content/files/WALMART_PRIVACY_MR.pdf|archive-date=December 3, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Berman|first=Jillian|title=Walmart Now Possesses Info On An Estimated 145 Million Americans: Analysis|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/walmart-data_n_4344879.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=November 27, 2013|date=November 26, 2013}}</ref>

===Labor relations===
[[File:Wal-Mart Workers and Wal-Mart-Free NYC at Occupy Wall Street.vorb.oga|thumb|right|Wal-Mart workers speak during [[Occupy Wall Street]].]]With over 2.2 million employees worldwide, Walmart has faced a torrent of lawsuits and issues with regards to its workforce. These issues involve [[wage|low wages]], [[Occupational safety and health|poor working conditions]], inadequate [[health care]], as well as issues involving the company's strong [[trade union|anti-union]] policies. In November 2013 the [[National Labor Relations Board|National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)]] announced that it had found that in 13 U.S. states Wal-Mart had pressured employees not to engage in strikes on Black Friday, and had illegally disciplined workers who had engaged in strikes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-nlrb-walmart-20131119,0,1499317.story#axzz2lfbzVSap|title=Fully staffed NLRB investigates complaints against Wal-Mart|first=Alana|last=Semuels|work=|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=November 26, 2013|date=November 19, 2013}}</ref> Critics point to Walmart's high [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]] rate as evidence of an unhappy workforce, although other factors may be involved.

Retrieved on February 24, 2007.</ref> Despite this turnover rate, the company is still able to affect unemployment rates. This was found in a study by Oklahoma State University which states, "Walmart is found to have substantially lowered the relative unemployment rates of blacks in those counties where it is present, but to have had only a limited impact on relative incomes after the influences of other socio-economic variables were taken into account."<ref>Keil, Stanley R., Spector, Lee C.

===Gender and sexual orientation===
In 2007, a [[Discrimination|gender discrimination]] lawsuit, ''[[Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.]]'', was filed against Walmart, alleging that female employees were discriminated against in matters regarding pay and promotions. A [[class action]] suit was sought, which would have been the nation's largest in history, covering 1.5&nbsp;million past and current employees.<ref name="newsmax">{{cite news|title=Wal-Mart Faces Class-Action Lawsuit |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/2/6/130433.shtml |accessdate=June 21, 2011|newspaper=Newsmax|date=February 6, 2007}}</ref> On June 20, 2011, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled in Wal-Mart's favor, stating that the plaintiffs did not have enough in common to constitute a class.<ref name="SCOTUS_Walmart">{{cite news|title=Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Petitioner v.

Wal-Mart's rating on the [[Human Rights Campaign]]'s [[Corporate Equality Index]], a measure of how companies treat [[LGBT]] employees and customers, has fluctuated widely during the past decade, from a low of 14 percent (2002) to 65 percent (2006) to 90 percent (2016).
