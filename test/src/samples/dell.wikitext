{{Main|History of Dell}}
[[File:Dellpre1989.JPG|thumb|left|Dell's first logo from 1984 to 1989]]

Dell traces its origins to 1984, when [[Michael Dell]] created Dell Computer Corporation, which at the time did business as ''PC's Limited'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/michael-dell-9542199 |title=Michael Dell Biography – Facts, Birthday, Life Story |publisher=Biography.com |date=February 23, 1965 |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Michael Dell with an early model of a PC’s Limited computer| url = http://pinterest.com/pin/208643395206891882/| accessdate = September 3, 2013}}</ref> while a student of the [[University of Texas at Austin]].

In 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the ''Turbo PC'', which sold for $795.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Koehn |first=Nancy Fowler |title=Brand New: How Entrepreneurs Earned Consumers' Trust from Wedgwood to Dell |publisher=[[Harvard Business Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-57851-221-8 |page=287 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7j8VefeqUk4C&printsec=frontcover |accessdate=October 14, 2008}}</ref> PC's Limited advertised its systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers and custom assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options. The company [[gross profit|grossed]] more than $73&nbsp;million in its first year of operation.

In 1986, Michael Dell brought in Lee Walker, a 51-year-old venture capitalist, as president and chief operating officer, to serve as Michael's mentor and implement Michael's ideas for growing the company. Walker was also instrumental in recruiting members to the board of directors when the company went public in 1988. Walker retired in 1990 due to health, and Michael Dell hired Morton Meyerson, former CEO and president of [[Electronic Data Systems]] to transform the company from a fast-growing medium-sized firm into a billion-dollar enterprise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhhe.com/business/management/updates/thompson12e/case/dell4.html |title=Dell Computer Corporation Online Case |publisher=Mhhe.com |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref>

The company dropped the PC’s Limited name in 1987 to become Dell Computer Corporation and began expanding globally. In June 1988, Dell's market capitalization grew by $30&nbsp;million to $80&nbsp;million from its June 22 [[initial public offering]] of 3.5&nbsp;million shares at $8.50 a share.<ref>Website 1000ventures.com: Case study on:[http://www.1000ventures.com/business_guide/cs_im_dell.html Dell Inc.], visited: October 28, 2012</ref> In 1992, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's [[Fortune Global 500|500]] largest companies, making Michael Dell the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.<ref name=NatPressClub>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/programs/npc/2000/000608.mdell.html|title=Michael Dell|work=National Press Club Summary|publisher=NPR|accessdate=May 28, 2012|date=June 8, 2008}}</ref>

In 1993, to complement its own direct sales channel, Dell planned to sell PCs at big-box retail outlets such as Wal-Mart, which would have brought in an additional $125 million in annual revenue. Bain consultant [[Kevin Rollins]] persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals, believing they would be money losers in the long run.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rivlin |first=Gary |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/technology/11dell.html?pagewanted=all |title=He Naps.

===Growth in the 1990s and early 2000s===
Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed when the company’s Internet site took off in 1996 and 1997. While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.<ref name="mhhe.com"/>

From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as [[Compaq]], [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]], [[IBM Aptiva|IBM]], [[Packard Bell]], and [[AST Research]] struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out.<ref name="ZDA">ZDNET Asia: [http://www.zdnetasia.com/michael-dell-back-as-ceo-rollins-resigns-61986298.htm Michael Dell back as CEO] February 1, 2007.

Operating costs made up only 10 percent of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21 percent of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25 percent at Gateway, and 46 percent at Cisco.<ref name="autogenerated2003">{{cite news|last=Jones |first=Kathryn |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2003/02/01/335960/ |title=The Dell Way Michael Dell's famous business model made his company the world's premier computer maker.

Can "the Model" stand the strain? – February 1, 2003 |publisher=CNN |date=February 1, 2003 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> In 2002, when Compaq merged with [[Hewlett Packard]] (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead. Dell grew the fastest in the early 2000s.<ref name="bw1103"/>

Dell attained and maintained the number&nbsp;1 rating in PC reliability and customer service/technical support, according to ''Consumer Reports'', year after year, during the mid-to-late 90s through 2001 right before ''Windows XP'' was released.

In 1996, Dell began selling computers through its website.

In the mid-1990s, Dell expanded beyond desktop computers and laptops by selling servers, starting with low-end servers. The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran [[Microsoft Windows NT]] on Intel chips, and could be built cheaper than its competitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhhe.com/business/management/updates/thompson12e/case/dell8.html |title=Dell Computer Corporation Online Case |publisher=Mhhe.com |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13 percent of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31 percent of the market. Dell's first [[business acquisition|acquisition]] occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.<ref name="autogenerated2003"/>

In 2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, [[handhelds]], digital audio players, and [[Printer (computing)|printers]]. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO [[Kevin Rollins]]'s attempt to lessen the company's heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring [[EMC Corporation]].<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite news|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/06/13/michael-dells-dilemma/ |title=Michael Dell's dilemma – Fortune Tech |work=Fortune |date=June 13, 2011 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref>

In 2003, the company was rebranded as simply "Dell Inc." to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers.<ref name="Dell-Inc-May-2003-PRE-14A">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1992/95013403007092/filing-main.htm |title=Dell Inc, Form PRE 14A, Filing Date May 5, 2003 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =March 8, 2013}}</ref>

In 2004, Michael Dell resigned as CEO while retaining the position of Chairman,<ref name="Dell-Inc-May-2004-DEF-14A">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1422/95013404008188/filing-main.htm |title=Dell Inc, Form DEF 14A, Filing Date May 27, 2004 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =March 8, 2013}}</ref> handing the CEO title to Kevin Rollins, who had been President and COO since 2001. Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with Rollins.<ref name="autogenerated3"/>

Under Rollins, Dell began to loosen its ties to Microsoft and Intel, the two companies responsible for Dell's dominance in the PC business. During that time, Dell acquired [[Alienware]],<ref name="Dell-Inc-Mar-2006-8-K">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2598/115752306002942/filing-main.htm |title=Dell Inc, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Mar 23, 2006 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =March 8, 2013}}</ref> which introduced several new items to Dell products, including [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] microprocessors. To prevent cross-market products, Dell continues to run Alienware as a separate entity, but still a wholly owned subsidiary.

===Disappointments===
In 2005, while earnings and sales continued to rise, sales growth slowed considerably, and the company stock lost 25% of its value that year.<ref name="BW0206">Bloomberg-Businessweek [http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2006/tc20060223_710372.htm?chan=search Its Dell vs the Dell way], February 2006.

The slowing sales growth has been attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage, services and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs,<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1014_3-6155185.html |title=Michael Dell back as CEO; Rollins resigns – CNET News |publisher=CNET |date=January 31, 2007 |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref> but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation.<ref name="news.cnet.com">{{cite web|last=Haff |first=Gordon |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13556_3-10471396-61.html |title=The real Dell 2.0 &#124; The Pervasive Data Center – CNET News |publisher=CNET |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Throughout the entire PC industry, declines in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers (a lucrative strategy of encouraging buyers to upgrade the processor or memory). As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins.<ref name="ZDA"/> The laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the PC market, but Dell produced low-cost notebooks in China like other PC manufacturers which eliminated Dell's manufacturing cost advantages, plus Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores.[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-9829431-17.html]<ref name="nytimes2006"/> ''CNET'' has suggested that Dell was getting trapped in the increasing commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Despite plans of expanding into other global regions and product segments, Dell was heavily dependent on U.S. corporate PC market, as desktop PCs sold to both commercial and corporate customers accounted for 32 percent of its revenue, 85 percent of its revenue comes from businesses, and Sixty-four percent of its revenue comes from North and South America, according to its 2006 third-quarter results. U.S. shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market which purchases PCs in upgrade cycles had largely decided to take a break from buying new systems. The last cycle started around 2002, three or so years after companies started buying PCs ahead of the perceived Y2K problems, and corporate clients were not expected to upgrade again until extensive testing of Microsoft's [[Windows Vista]] (expected in early 2007), putting the next upgrade cycle around 2008.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Dell-revamps-product-group%2C-adds-executives/2100-11746_3-6143163.html |title=Dell revamps product group, adds executives – CNET News |publisher=CNET |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Dells-dog-days-of-summer/2100-1014_3-6097185.html |title=Dell's dog days of summer – CNET News |publisher=CNET |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Heavily depending on PCs, Dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes, while demanding deep cuts from suppliers.<ref name="autogenerated3"/>

Dell had long stuck by its direct sales model. Consumers had become the main drivers of PC sales in recent years,<ref name="ReferenceB"/> yet there had a decline in consumers purchasing PCs through the Web or on the phone, as increasing numbers were visiting consumer electronics retail stores to try out the devices first. Dell's rivals in the PC industry, HP, Gateway and Acer, had a long retail presence and so were well poised to take advantage of the consumer shift.<ref name="director1">{{cite web|url=http://director.co.uk/MAGAZINE/2009/4%20April/Michael_Dell_62_9.html |title=Michael Dell &#124; Dell |publisher=Director.co.uk |author=Woodward, David |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140815101949/http://director.co.uk/MAGAZINE/2009/4%20April/Michael_Dell_62_9.html |archivedate=August 15, 2014 }}</ref> The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell's attempts to offer consumer electronics such as flat-panel TVs and MP3 players.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Dell responded by experimenting with mall kiosks, plus quasi-retail stores in Texas and New York.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon supply chain efficiencies to sell established technologies at low prices, instead of being an innovator.<ref name="autogenerated3"/><ref name="autogenerated3"/><ref name="director1"/><ref>Michael Dell had a risk-averse management style and he openly mocked rivals that spent on R&D (research and development) and acquisitions, though by the late 2000s this may have contributed to Dell missing market shifts like mobile phones and tablet computers.[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-24/boeings-787-dreamliner-and-the-decline-of-innovation#p2]</ref> By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell's low spending on R&D relative to its revenue (compared to [[IBM]], [[Hewlett Packard]], and [[Apple Inc.]])—which worked well in the commoditized PC market—prevented it from making inroads into more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and later mobile devices.<ref name="BW0206"/> Increasing spending on R&D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized.<ref name="bw1103"/> Dell had done well with a horizontal organization that focused on PCs when the computing industry moved to horizontal mix-and-match layers in the 1980s, but by the mid-2000 the industry shifted to vertically integrated stacks to deliver complete IT solutions and Dell lagged far behind competitors like Hewlett Packard and Oracle.<ref name="news.cnet.com"/>

Dell's reputation for poor customer service, since 2002, which was exacerbated as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure, came under increasing scrutiny on the Web. The original Dell model was known for high customer satisfaction when PCs sold for thousands but by the 2000s, the company could not justify that level of service when computers in the same lineup sold for hundreds.<ref>{{cite web|last=Silverman |first=Dwight |url=http://blog.chron.com//techblog/2005/07/hey-dell-are-you-listening/ |title=Hey, Dell: Are you listening? – TechBlog |work=Houston Chronicle |date=July 3, 2005 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting "got in the way," aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve on this, and rolled out ''DellConnect'' to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional "bloatware" on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the "Dell Hell" prominent on Internet search engines.<ref name="nytimes2006"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/printer/articles/294370-dell-learns-to-listen?type=old_article |title=Dell Learns to Listen |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=October 17, 2007 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref>

There was also criticism that Dell used faulty components for its PCs, particularly the 11.8 million OptiPlex desktop computers sold to businesses and governments from May 2003 to July 2005, that suffered from bad capacitors made by a company called Nichicon.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/technology/29dell.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ashlee | last=Vance | title=In Suit Over Faulty Computers, Window to Dell's Fall | date=June 28, 2010}}</ref> A battery recall in August 2006, as a result of a Dell laptop catching fire caused much negative attention for the company though later, [[Sony]] was found responsible for the faulty batteries.<ref name="ZDA"/>

2006 marked the first year that Dell's growth was slower than the PC industry as a whole.

These include elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards, reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Michael Dell from 20 to 12, and reduction of "[[bureaucracy]]". Jim Schneider retired as CFO and was replaced by [[Donald Carty]], as the company came under an SEC probe for its accounting practices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Dell-CFO-stepping-down-in-January/2100-1003_3-6144950.html |title=Dell CFO stepping down in January – CNET News |publisher=CNET |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref>

On April 23, 2008, Dell announced the closure of one of its biggest Canadian call-centers in [[Kanata, Ontario]], terminating approximately 1100 employees, with 500 of those redundancies effective on the spot, and with the official closure of the center scheduled for the summer. The call-center had opened in 2006 after the city of [[Ottawa]] won a bid to host it. Less than a year later, Dell  planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers add a new building. These plans were reversed, due to a high [[Canadian dollar]] that made the Ottawa staff relatively expensive, and also as part of Dell's turnaround, which involved moving these call-center jobs offshore to cut costs.<ref>{{cite news|author = Seggewiss, Krista & Hill, Bert| title = The Dell dream dies

Typical leveraged buyouts have been viewed as tools of [[vulture capitalist]]s. Ordinarily, the buyer seeks to break up the firm and layoff workers, or bring greater efficiency and new management to a troubled firm. The Dell leveraged buyout is unusual because the driving force behind the deal was not a vulture capitalist, but rather, Michael Dell, who was already the Chairman and CEO, founder, and largest shareholder of the firm. Unlike most leveraged buyouts that aim to wrest management control away from incumbents, the Dell deal intends to keep the same leadership team in place. The main aim of Dell's leveraged buyout is to rejigger the company’s financial structure.<ref name=dodge/><ref name=dodge>[http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/02/dell_goes_private_leveraged_buyout_will_help_dell_pay_investors_while_minimizing.html "Dell’s Gigantic Tax Dodge"] ''Slate'', February 5, 2013</ref><ref name=dodge/><ref name=10k12>[http://i.dell.com/sites/content/corporate/secure/en/Documents/FY12_Form10K.pdf "Dell, Inc.

===Manufacturing===
From its early beginnings, Dell operated as a pioneer in the "configure to order" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications. In contrast, most PC manufacturers in those times delivered large orders to intermediaries on a quarterly basis.<ref>Dedrick, J. and Kraemer, K. L. (March 2007) [http://web.archive.org/web/20120427221617/http://pcic.merage.uci.edu/papers/2007/MarketMaking.pdf "Market Making in the PC Industry"], Chapter 10, in Hamilton, Senauer and Petrovic (eds) ''The Market Makers: How Retailers are Reshaping the Global Economy''. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0199655871</ref>

To minimize the delay between purchase and delivery, Dell has a general policy of manufacturing its products close to its customers. This also allows for implementing a [[just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] (JIT) manufacturing approach, which minimizes [[inventory]] costs. Low inventory is another signature of the Dell business model—a critical consideration in an industry where components depreciate very rapidly.<ref>Kraemer, K. L. and Dedrick, J. (2002) [http://web.archive.org/web/20120427221617/http://crito.uci.edu/papers/2002/dell.pdf "Dell Computer: Organization of a Global Production Network"], Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations.</ref>

Dell's manufacturing process covers assembly, software installation, functional testing (including "burn-in"), and quality control. Throughout most of the company's history, Dell manufactured desktop machines in-house and contracted out manufacturing of base notebooks for configuration in-house.<ref>Company Annual Reports, various years.</ref> The company's approach has changed, as cited in the 2006 Annual Report, which states, "We are continuing to expand our use of original design manufacturing partnerships and manufacturing outsourcing relationships." ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported in September 2008 that "Dell has approached contract computer manufacturers with offers to sell" their plants.<ref>Scheck, J: "Dell Plans to Sell Factories in Effort to Cut Costs", ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 5, 2008.</ref> By the late 2000s, Dell's "configure to order" approach of manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications from its US facilities was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers as PCs became powerful low-cost commodities.<ref name="statesman1"/>

Assembly of desktop computers for the North American market formerly took place at Dell plants in [[Austin, Texas]] (original location) and [[Lebanon, Tennessee]] (opened in 1999), which have been closed in 2008 and early 2009, respectively. The plant in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] received $280 million USD in incentives from the state and opened in 2005, but ceased operations in November 2010, and Dell's contract with the state requires them to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions.<ref name="theregister.co.uk"/><ref name="bizjournals.com"/>  Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's own factories overseas. The [[Miami, Florida]] facility of its [[Alienware]] subsidiary remains in operation, while Dell continues to produce its servers (its most profitable products) in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref name="statesman1"/>

Dell assembled computers for the [[Europe, the Middle East, and Africa|EMEA]] market at the [[Limerick]] facility in the Republic of Ireland, and once employed about 4,500 people in that country. Dell began manufacturing in Limerick in 1991 and went on to become Ireland's largest exporter of goods and its second-largest company and foreign investor. On January 8, 2009, Dell announced that it would move all Dell manufacturing in Limerick to Dell's new plant in the Polish city of [[Łódź]] by January 2010.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20130116235908/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0108/Dell.html 1,900 jobs lost at Dell in Limerick].

Dell opened plants in Penang, [[Malaysia]] in 1995, and in Xiamen, China in 1999. These facilities serve the Asian market and assemble 95% of Dell notebooks. Dell Inc. has invested{{When|date=October 2009}} an estimated $60&nbsp;million in a new manufacturing unit in [[Chennai]], India, to support the sales of its products in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Indian-made products bear the "Made in India" mark.

==Commercial aspects==

===Organization===
The board consists of nine directors. [[Michael Dell]], the founder of the company, serves as chairman of the board and chief executive officer. Other board members include [[Donald J. Carty|Don Carty]], [[William H. Gray (congressman)|William Gray]], [[Judy Lewent]], [[Klaus Luft]], [[Alex J. Mandl|Alex Mandl]], [[Michael A. Miles]], and [[Sam Nunn]]. [[Shareholder]]s elect the nine board members at meetings, and those board members who do not get a majority of votes must submit a resignation to the board, which will subsequently choose whether or not to accept the resignation. The board of directors usually sets up five committees having oversight over specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues, including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the Finance Committee, which handles financial matters such as proposed mergers and acquisitions; the Governance and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters (including nomination of the board); and the Antitrust Compliance Committee, which attempts to prevent company practices from violating [[antitrust]] laws. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Day-to-day operations of the company are run by the Global Executive Management Committee, which sets [[Strategic management|strategic direction]]. Dell has regional senior vice-presidents for countries other than the United States, including David Marmonti for [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] and Stephen J. Felice for Asia/Japan. {{As of|2007}}, other officers included Martin Garvin (senior vice president for worldwide procurement) and [[Susan Sheskey]] (vice president and [[Chief Information Officer]]). {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Marketing===
Dell advertisements have appeared in several types of media including television, the Internet, magazines, [[Mail-order catalog|catalogs]] and newspapers. Some of Dell Inc's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors. In 2006, Dell [http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2006/tc20060223_710372.htm?chan=search cut its prices] in an effort to maintain its 19.2% market share. This also cut profit-margins by more than half, from 8.7 to 4.3 percent. To maintain its low prices, Dell continues to accept most purchases of its products via the Internet and through the telephone network, and to move its customer-care division to India and [[El Salvador]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090105132801/http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_03_20_ndi_000?c=us&l=en&s=corp Michael Dell Sees India Playing a Key Role in the Online World].

A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor [[Ben Curtis (actor)|Ben Curtis]] playing the part of "Steven", a lightly mischievous blond-haired youth who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: "Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!"<ref name=SlateDell>{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Rob|title=The Mystery of the Dell Dude|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/ad_report_card/2002/06/the_mystery_of_the_dell_dude.html|website=slate.com|publisher=Slate Magazine|accessdate=14 October 2015}}</ref>

A subsequent advertising campaign featured [[intern]]s at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).

In 2007, Dell switched advertising agencies in the US from [[BBDO]] to [[Working Mother]] Media. In July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Working Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines. The ads featured music from the [[The Flaming Lips|Flaming Lips]] and [[Devo]] who re-formed especially to record the song in the ad "Work it Out". Also in 2007, Dell began using the slogan "Yours is here" to say that it customizes computers to fit customers' requirements.<ref name="engadget">{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/21/dell-launches-star-studded-yours-is-here-ad-campaign/|title=Dell launches star-studded "Yours Is Here" ad campaign|work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=July 14, 2010}}</ref>

Beginning in 2011, Dell began hosting a conference in Austin, Texas at the Austin Convention Center titled "Dell World".  The event featured new technology and services provided by Dell and Dell's partners.  In 2011, the event was held October 12–14.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dell World 2011 |publisher=Dell |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |url=http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/corp-comm/pk-dellworld-2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20131124094728/http://www.dell.com:80/learn/us/en/uscorp1/corp-comm/pk-dellworld-2011 |archivedate=November 24, 2013 }}</ref>  In 2012, the event was held December 11–13.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dell World 2012 Press Kit |publisher=Dell |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |url=http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/secure/2012-dell-world-press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130517115347/http://www.dell.com:80/Learn/us/en/uscorp1/secure/2012-dell-world-press |archivedate=May 17, 2013 }}</ref>  In 2013, the event was held December 11–13.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dell World 2013 |publisher=Dell |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |url=https://dellworld2013.activeevents.com/portal/newreg.ww |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20131217050630/https://dellworld2013.activeevents.com/portal/newreg.ww |archivedate=December 17, 2013 }}</ref>

====Dell partner program====
In late 2007, Dell Inc. announced that it planned to expand its program to [[value-added reseller]]s (VARs), giving it the official name of "Dell Partner Direct" and a new Website.<ref>{{cite web | title = Partner Direct | publisher=Dell  | accessdate =June 13, 2011 | url = http://partner.Dell.com/}}</ref>

====Criticisms of marketing of laptop security====
In 2008, Dell received press coverage over its claim of having the world's most secure laptops, specifically, its Latitude D630 and Latitude D830.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2220173/dell-scolded-laptop-ads |title=Dell Scolded for Laptop Ads |publisher=Vnunet.com |author=Nichols, Shaun |date=June 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20081023034729/http://www.vnunet.com:80/vnunet/news/2220173/dell-scolded-laptop-ads |archivedate=October 23, 2008 }}</ref> At Lenovo's request, the (U.S.) National Advertising Division (NAD) evaluated the claim, and reported that Dell did not have enough evidence to support it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20080623/dont-worry-Dell-your-laptops-are-still-the-worlds-ugliest/ |title=Dell's Claim as World's Most Secure Commercial Laptops? |publisher=Digitaldaily.allthingsd.com |date=June 23, 2008 |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref>

===Retail===
Dell first opened their retail stores in India.<ref name="tech.fortune.cnn.com"/>

====United States====
In the early 1990s, Dell sold its products through [[Best Buy]], [[Costco]] and [[Sam's Club]] stores in the United States. Dell stopped this practice in 1994, citing low profit-margins on the business, exclusively distributing through a direct-sales model for the next decade. In 2003, Dell briefly sold products in [[Sears]] stores in the U.S. In 2007, Dell started shipping its products to major retailers in the U.S. once again, starting with [[Sam's Club]] and [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]]. [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], the largest office-supply retailer in the U.S., and [[Best Buy]], the largest electronics retailer in the U.S., became Dell retail partners later that same year.

=====Kiosks=====
Starting in 2002, Dell opened [[kiosk]] locations in the United States to allow customers to examine products before buying them directly from the company. Starting in 2005, Dell expanded [[kiosk]] locations to include shopping malls across Australia, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong. On January 30, 2008, Dell announced it would shut down all 140 kiosks in the U.S. due to expansion into retail stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/press-releases/2008-01-30-00-direct-retail.aspx |title=Dell Focuses on Direct and Retail Business, Closes Kiosks in U.S |publisher=Content.dell.com |date=January 30, 2008 |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20111113024054/http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/press-releases/2008-01-30-00-direct-retail.aspx |archivedate=November 13, 2011 }}</ref>

By June 3, 2010, Dell had also shut down all of its mall kiosks in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2010/04/dell-closing-down-their-retail-kiosks-across-the-country/|title=Dell Closing Down Their Retail Kiosks Across The Country  |publisher=gizmodo.com |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}</ref>

=====NorthPark Service Center=====
In 2006, Dell Inc. opened one full store, {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} in area, at [[NorthPark Center]] in [[Dallas]], Texas. It operates the retail outlet seven days a week to display about 36 models, including PCs and televisions. As at the kiosks, customers can only see demonstration-computers and place orders through agents. Dell then delivers purchased items just as if the customer had placed the order by phone or over the Internet.

In addition to showcasing products, the stores also support on-site warranties and non-warranty service ("Dell Solution Station"). Services offered include repairing computer video-cards and removing spyware from hard drives.

On February 14, 2008, Dell closed the Service Center in its Dallas NorthPark store and laid off all the technical staff there.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Retail stores====
{{As of|2008|2|alt=As of the end of February 2008}}, Dell products shipped to one of the largest office-supply retailers in Canada, [[Staples Business Depot]]. In April 2008, [[Future Shop]] and [[Best Buy]] began carrying a subset of Dell products, such as certain desktops, laptops, printers, and monitors.

Since some shoppers in certain markets show reluctance to purchase technological products through the phone or the Internet, Dell has looked into opening retail operations in some countries in Central Europe and Russia. In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in [[Budapest]]. In October of the same year, Dell opened a retail store in Moscow.

In the UK, [[HMV]]'s flagship [[Trocadero (London)|Trocadero]] store has sold Dell XPS PCs since December 2007. From January 2008 the UK stores of [[DSG International (retailer)|DSGi]] have sold Dell products (in particular, through [[Currys]] and [[PC World (retailer)|PC World]] stores). As of 2008, the large supermarket-chain [[Tesco]] has sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK.

In May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with office supply chain, [[Officeworks]] (part of [[Coles Group]]), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range. These models have slightly different model numbers, but almost replicate the ones available from the Dell Store. Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with [[Harris Technology]] (another part of Coles Group) in November of the same year. In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with discount electrical retailer, [[The Good Guys (Australasia)|The Good Guys]], known for "Slashing Prices". Dell agreed to distribute a variety of makes of both desktops and notebooks, including [[Studio]] and [[Dell XPS|XPS]] systems in late 2008. Dell and [[Dick Smith Electronics]] (owned by [[Woolworths Limited]]) reached an agreement to expand within Dick Smith's 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand in May 2009 (1 year since Officeworks&nbsp;— owned by Coles Group&nbsp;— reached a deal). The retailer has agreed to distribute a variety of [[Inspiron]] and [[Studio]] notebooks, with minimal Studio desktops from the Dell range. {{As of|2009}}, Dell continues to run and operate its various kiosks in 18 shopping centres throughout Australia. On March 31, 2010 Dell announced to Australian Kiosk employees that they were shutting down the Australian/New Zealand Dell kiosk program.

In Germany, Dell is selling selected smartphones and notebooks via [[Media Markt]] and Saturn, as well as some shopping websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netzwelt.de/news/87864-discounter-check-dell-venue-pro-media-markt.html |title=Dell Venue Pro offered by Media Markt |publisher=Netzwelt.de |date=February 22, 1999 |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref>

===Competition===
Dell's major competitors include [[Hewlett-Packard Company|Hewlett-Packard]] (HP), [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Fujitsu]], [[Toshiba]], [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]], [[Sony]], [[Asus]], [[Lenovo Group|Lenovo]], [[IBM]], [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Panasonic]] with its [[Toughbook]] series, [[Samsung]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]. Dell and its subsidiary, [[Alienware]], compete in the enthusiast market against [[AVADirect]], [[Falcon Northwest]], [[VoodooPC]] (a subsidiary of HP), and other manufacturers. In the second quarter of 2006, Dell had between 18% and 19% share of the worldwide personal computer market, compared to HP with roughly 15%.

{{As of|2006|alt=In late 2006}}, Dell lost its lead in the PC-business to Hewlett-Packard. Both [[Gartner]] and [[International Data Corporation|IDC]] estimated that in the third quarter of 2006, HP shipped more units<ref>Kirdahy, Matthew (October 19, 2006)  [http://www.forbes.com/2006/10/19/dell-computer-earnings-markets-equity-cx_mk_1019markets07.html]. Forbes.</ref> worldwide than Dell did. Dell's 3.6% growth paled in comparison to HP's 15% growth during the same period. The problem got worse in the fourth quarter, when Gartner estimated<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20070117006106&newsLang=en |title=Gartner Says Hewlett-Packard Takes Clear Lead in Fourth Quarter Worldwide PC Shipments and Creates a Virtual Tie with Dell for 2006 Year-End Results |publisher=Business Wire |date=January 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref> that Dell PC shipments declined 8.9% (versus HP's 23.9% growth). As a result, at the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market-share stood at 13.9% (versus HP's 17.4%).

IDC reported that Dell lost more server market share than any of the top four competitors in that arena. IDC's Q4 2006 estimates show Dell's share of the server market at 8.1%, down from 9.5% in the previous year. This represents an 8.8% loss year-over-year, primarily to competitors [[EMC Corporation|EMC]] and [[IBM]].

===Partnership with EMC===
The Dell/EMC brand applies solely to products that result from Dell's partnership with [[EMC Corporation]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In some cases, Dell and EMC jointly design such products. Other cases involve EMC products that Dell supports—generally midrange storage systems, such as [[fibre channel]] and [[iSCSI]] [[storage area network]]s. The relationship also promotes and sells OEM versions of backup, recovery, replication and archiving software.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.Dell.com/emc |title=Dell/EMC products |publisher=Dell.com |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref>

On December 9, 2008, Dell and EMC announced the multi-year extension, through 2013, of their strategic partnership that began in 2001. In addition, Dell plans to expand its product line-up by adding the EMC [[Celerra]] NX4 storage system to the portfolio of Dell/EMC family of networked storage systems, as well as partnering on a new line of [[data deduplication|de-duplication]] products as part of its TierDisk family of [[data storage device|data-storage devices]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2008/2008_12_09_rr_000?c=us&l=en |title=Dell, EMC Extend and Expand Strategic Alliance |publisher=Dell |date=December 9, 2008 |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}</ref>

==Environmental record==
Dell committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its global activities by 40% by 2015, with 2008 fiscal year as the baseline year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/corp-comm/cr-earth-emissions.aspx |title=Walking the Walk on Greenhouse Gas Reduction |publisher=Dell|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}</ref>  It is listed in [[Greenpeace]]’s Guide to Greener Electronics that scores leading electronics manufacturers according to their policies on sustainability, climate and energy and how green their products are.

Dell was the first company to publicly state a timeline for the elimination of toxic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs), which it planned to phase out by the end of 2009. It revised this commitment and now aims to remove these toxics by the end of 2011 but only in its computing products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/toxics/2010/version16/Ranking%20tables%20Oct%202010-Dell.pdf|title=Ranking tables – October 2010|publisher=Greenpeace International|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}</ref>

===Green initiatives===
Dell became the first company in the [[information technology industry]] to establish a product-[[recycling]] goal (in 2004) and completed the implementation of its global consumer recycling-program in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/1421.html|title=Dell First US Computer Company to Commit to a Global Recycling Goal|author=William Baue|publisher=SocialFunds}}</ref>

On July 19, 2007, Dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009. The company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of IT equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment Dell sold seven years earlier.<ref name="Dell Inc.">[http://web.archive.org/web/20130116172136/http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/press-releases/2007-07-19-01-recycle.aspx Dell Ahead of Schedule to Achieve Multi-Year Product Recycling Goal]. Dell. July 19, 2007</ref>

On June 5, 2007, Dell set a goal of becoming the greenest technology company on Earth for the long term.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The company launched a [[zero-carbon]] initiative that includes:
# reducing Dell's [[carbon intensity]] by 15 percent by 2012
# requiring primary suppliers to report carbon emissions data during quarterly business reviews
# partnering with customers to build the "greenest PC on the planet"
# expanding the company's carbon-offsetting program, "Plant a Tree for Me"

The company introduced the term "[[The Re-Generation]]" during a [[round table]] in London commemorating 2007 [[World Environment Day]]. "The Re-Generation" refers to people of all ages throughout the world who want to make a difference in improving the world's environment. Dell also talked about plans to take the lead in setting an environmental standard for the technology industry and maintaining that leadership in the future.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Dell reports its environmental performance in an annual [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] (CSR) Report that follows the [[Global Reporting Initiative]] (GRI) protocol. Dell's 2008 CSR report ranked as "Application Level B" as "checked by GRI".<ref>Dell 2008 Corporate Social Responsibility Report: [http://i.Dell.com/sites/content/corporate/environment/en/Documents/Dell%20Corporate%20Responsibility%20Report%202008.pdf Section "GRI Performance Indicators Index"], Dell Inc, 2008. Retrieved October 28, 2012</ref>

The company aims to reduce its external environmental impact through energy-efficient evolution of products, and also reduce its direct operational impact through energy-efficiency programs. Internal energy-efficiency programs reportedly save the company more than $3&nbsp;million annually in energy-cost savings. The largest component of the company's internal energy-efficiency savings comes through [[PC power management]]: the company expects to save $1.8&nbsp;million in energy costs through using specialized energy-management software on a network of 50,000 PCs.

==Criticism==
{{See also|Lawsuits involving Dell Inc.}}

In the 1990s, Dell switched from using primarily [[ATX]] [[motherboard]]s and [[Computer power supply|PSU]] to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors. This meant customers wishing to upgrade their hardware would have to replace parts with scarce Dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts. While motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, Dell continues to remain secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as MMC readers and power on/off switches and LEDs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=339053 |title=Dell proprietary (non-standard) ATX design > Dell proprietary (non-standard) ATX design |publisher=InformIT |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>Mueller, Scott (2002).

In July 2009, Dell apologized after drawing the ire of the Taiwanese Consumer Protection Commission for twice refusing to honour a flood of orders against unusually low prices offered on its Taiwanese website. In the first instance, Dell offered a 19" LCD panel for $15. In the second instance, Dell offered its Latitude E4300 notebook at NT$18,558 (US$580), 70% lower than usual price of NT$60,900 (US$1900). Concerning the E4300, rather than honour the discount taking a significant loss, the firm withdrew orders and offered a voucher of up to NT$20,000 (US$625) a customer in compensation. The consumer rights authorities in Taiwan fined Dell NT$1&nbsp;million (US$31250) for customer rights infringements. Many consumers sued the firm for the unfair compensation. A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 (US$15,120), less than a third of the normal price.<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2010/06/07/2003474881 Dell loses Taiwan consumer lawsuit: report], June 7, 2010.

After Michael Dell made a $24.4 billion buyout bid in August 2013, activist shareholder [[Carl Icahn]] sued the company and its board in an attempt to derail the bid and promote his own forthcoming offer.<ref>{{cite news| title=Icahn sues Dell in latest attempt to foil buyout | author=Poornima Gupta and Edwin Chan| agency=Reuters| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/02/us-dell-icahn-idUSBRE97012520130802?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&dlvrit=992637|  date=August 1, 2013}}</ref>
