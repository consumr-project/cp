==Origins and history==
[[File:Old Nike logo.jpg|thumb|Old logo of Nike, Inc., still used on some retro products with red boxes]]
[[File:NikeFactoryStoreVaughanMills.JPG|thumb|A Nike Factory Store]]

Nike, originally known as Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS), was founded by [[University of Oregon]] track athlete [[Phil Knight]] and his coach [[Bill Bowerman]] in January 1964. The company initially operated as a distributor for Japanese shoe maker [[ASICS|Onitsuka Tiger]] (now [[ASICS]]), making most sales at track meets out of Knight's automobile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikebiz.com/company_overview/history/1950s.html |title=Company Overview : History : 1950s |publisher=Nikebiz|accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref>

According to [[Otis Davis]], a student athlete whom Bowerman coached at the University of Oregon, who later went on to win two gold medals at the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], Bowerman made the first pair of Nike shoes for him, contradicting a claim that they were made for Phil Knight. Says Davis, "I told Tom Brokaw that I was the first. I don't care what all the billionaires say. Bill Bowerman made the first pair of shoes for me. People don't believe me. In fact, I didn't like the way they felt on my feet. There was no support and they were too tight. But I saw Bowerman make them from the [[waffle iron]], and they were mine."<ref name=HudReporter2006>{{cite web|author=[[Jim Hague|Hague, Jim]]|title=Truant officer was Olympic hero Emerson High has gold medalist in midst|publisher=The  Hudson Reporter|date=May 14, 2006|url=http://hudsonreporter.com/view/full_stories_home/2408547/article-Truant-officer-was-Olympic-hero-Emerson-High-has-gold-medallist-in-midst?|accessdate=2012-03-18}}</ref>

In 1964, in its first year in business, BRS sold 1,300 pairs of Japanese running shoes grossing $8,000. By 1965 the fledgling company had acquired a full-time employee, and sales had reached $20,000. In 1966, BRS opened its first retail store, located at 3107 Pico Boulevard in [[Santa Monica, California]] next to a beauty salon, so its employees no longer needed to sell inventory from the back of their cars. In 1967, due to rapidly increasing sales, BRS expanded retail and distribution operations on the East Coast, in Wellesley, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nike Company History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/nike-inc-history/}}</ref>

By 1971, the relationship between BRS and Onitsuka Tiger was nearing an end. BRS prepared to launch its own line of footwear, which would bear the [[Swoosh]] newly designed by [[Carolyn Davidson]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html| title = Logos that became legends: Icons from the world of advertising

In 1976, the company hired John Brown and Partners, based in Seattle, as its first advertising agency. The following year, the agency created the first "brand ad" for Nike, called "There is no finish line", in which no Nike product was shown. By 1980, Nike had attained a 50% market share in the U.S. athletic shoe market, and the company went public in December of that year.<ref name="nikeinc.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nikeinc.com/company_overview/history/1980s.html |title=Company Overview : History : 1970s |publisher=Nikebiz |accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref>

Together, Nike and Wieden+Kennedy have created many print and television advertisements, and Wieden+Kennedy remains Nike's primary ad agency. It was agency co-founder [[Dan Wieden]] who coined the now-famous slogan "[[Just Do It]]" for a 1988 Nike ad campaign, which was chosen by ''Advertising Age'' as one of the top five ad slogans of the 20th century and enshrined in the [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref name="nikebiz.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nikebiz.com/company_overview/history/1980s.html |title=Company Overview : History : 1970s |publisher=Nikebiz |accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref> [[Walt Stack]] was featured in Nike's first "Just Do It" advertisement, which debuted on July 1, 1988.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2008/07/nikes_just_do_it_slogan_celebr.html |title=Nike's 'Just Do It' slogan celebrates 20 years &#124; Oregon Business News |publisher=OregonLive.com |accessdate=2010-03-04 |date=July 18, 2008}}</ref> Wieden credits the inspiration for the slogan to "Let's do it", the last words spoken by [[Gary Gilmore]] before he was executed.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/business/media/20adco.html?_r=3&ref=business |author=Peters, Jeremy W. |title= The Birth of 'Just Do It' and Other Magic Words |date= August 19, 2009 |work=The New York Times |accessdate= 2009-09-30}}</ref>

Nike has contracted with more than 700 shops around the world and has offices located in 45 countries outside the United States.<ref>[http://www.nike.com/nikebiz/investors/reporting_sec/ar_99/corporate.html NikeBiz | Investors | Corporate] {{wayback|url=http://www.nike.com/nikebiz/investors/reporting_sec/ar_99/corporate.html |date=20070929090302 }}</ref> Most of the factories are located in Asia, including Indonesia, China, Taiwan, India,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/business/slide-show/slide-show-1-indias-50-most-trusted-brands/20110120.htm |title=India's 50 most trusted brands |publisher=rediff.com |date=2011-01-20}}</ref> Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan, Philippines, and Malaysia.<ref>[http://www.nike.com/nikebiz/gc/mp/pdf/disclosure_list_2005-06.pdf ] {{wayback|url=http://www.nike.com/nikebiz/gc/mp/pdf/disclosure_list_2005-06.pdf |date=20070620125833 }}</ref> Nike is hesitant to disclose information about the contract companies it works with.  However, due to harsh criticism from some organizations like [[CorpWatch]], Nike has disclosed information about its contract factories in its Corporate Governance Report.

===Sweatshops===
Nike has been criticized for contracting with factories (known as [[Nike sweatshops]]) in countries such as [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Mexico]]. Vietnam Labor Watch, an activist group, has documented that factories contracted by Nike have violated minimum wage and overtime laws in Vietnam as late as 1996, although Nike claims that this practice has been stopped.<ref>[http://www.saigon.com/nike/reports/report1.html Nike Labor Practices in Vietnam] {{wayback|url=http://www.saigon.com/nike/reports/report1.html |date=20010418214242 }}</ref>  The company has been subject to much critical coverage of the often poor working conditions and [[exploitation of labor|exploitation]] of cheap overseas labor employed in the [[free trade zone]]s where their goods are typically manufactured.  Sources for this criticism include [[Naomi Klein]]'s book ''[[No Logo]]'' and [[Michael Moore]] documentaries.

Campaigns have been taken up by many colleges and universities, especially [[anti-globalisation]] groups, as well as several [[anti-sweatshop]] groups such as the United Students Against Sweatshops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studentsagainstsweatshops.org//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=45&Itemid=27 |title=Sweatfree Campus Campaign Launch |publisher=Studentsagainstsweatshops.org |date=2005-09-28 |accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref>

As of July 2011, Nike stated that two-thirds of its factories producing Converse products still do not meet the company's standards for worker treatment. A July 2011 [[Associated Press]] article stated that employees at the company's plants in [[Indonesia]] reported constant abuse from supervisors.<ref>[[Associated Press]], "Nike still dogged by worker abuses", ''[[Japan Times]]'', July 15, 2011, p. 4.</ref>

===Child labor allegations===
During the 1990s, Nike faced criticism for the use of [[child labor]] in [[Cambodia]] and [[Pakistan]] in factories it contracted to manufacture soccer balls.  Although Nike took action to curb or at least reduce the practice, they continue to contract their production to companies that operate in areas where inadequate regulation and monitoring make it hard to ensure that child labor is not being used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/ipc/publications/pdf/02-007.pdf |title=MIT |format=PDF |accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref>

In 2001, a BBC documentary uncovered occurrences of child labor and poor working conditions in a Cambodian factory used by Nike.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sun Thyda, 12 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/970385.stm |title=Programmes &#124; Panorama &#124; Archive &#124; Gap and Nike: No Sweat? October 15, 2000 |publisher=BBC News  |date=2000-10-15 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref> The documentary focused on six girls, who all worked seven days a week, often 16 hours a day.

===Strike in China factory===
In April 2014, one of the biggest strikes in mainland China took place at the [[Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings]] [[Dongguan]] shoe factory, producing amongst others for Nike. Yue Yuen did underpay an employee by 250  yuan (40.82 US Dollars) per month. The average salary at Yue Yuen is 3000 yuan per month. The factory employs 70,000 people. This practice was in place for nearly 20 years.<ref>[http://www.clb.org.hk/en/content/more-ten-thousand-workers-stage-strike-massive-dongguan-shoe-factory More than ten thousand workers stage strike at massive Dongguan shoe factory], 2014-04-14</ref><ref>[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1483287/yue-yuen-shoe-factory-workers-strike-dongguan-plants-continues Yue Yuen shoe factory workers' strike at Dongguan plants continues], 2014-04-17.</ref><ref>[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1486399/yue-yuen-strikers-vow-continue-until-benefit-contribution-deficit-paid Yue Yuen strikers vow to continue until benefit contribution deficit paid in full], South China Morning Post, 2013-04-18.</ref>

===Justin Gatlin sponsorship===
In March 2015, Nike drew criticism after announcing a new sponsorship deal with American sprinter [[Justin Gatlin]] who had served two bans for doping. Nike had previously dropped Gatlin after his second failed drug test and resulting long term ban. Critics said that Nike was sending out a bad message by endorsing an athlete who has never been repentant for his actions and still causes widespread discontent within the sport. English sprinter [[Marlon Devonish]] described the deal as "a kick in the teeth to the 99% of guys who are clean".<ref>{{cite news|author=Ed Aarons |url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/25/justin-gatlin-paula-radcliffe-nike-deal-criticise|title=Paula Radcliffe criticises Nike for giving Justin Gatlin new sponsorship deal |publisher=[[The Guardian]]  |date=March 25, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Matt Slater |url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/athletics/32051389|title=Nike gives controversial sprinter Justin Gatlin sponsorship deal|publisher=[[BBC]]  |date=March 25, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Ben Bloom |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/11496111/Justin-Gatlin-not-only-threatens-Usain-Bolt-he-threatens-athletics.html|title=Justin Gatlin not only threatens Usain Bolt – he threatens athletics|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]  |date=March 26, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Ben Bloom |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/11495694/Nikes-decision-to-give-drugs-cheat-Justin-Gatlin-sponsorship-deal-is-absolute-nonsense.html|title=Nike's decision to give drugs cheat Justin Gatlin sponsorship deal is 'absolute nonsense' |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]  |date=March 25, 2015}}</ref>

==Environmental record==
According to the New England-based environmental organization Clean Air-Cool Planet, Nike ranks among the top three companies (out of 56) in a survey of climate-friendly companies.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zabarenko |first=Deborah |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSN1840883720070619?feedType=RSS |title=Reuters report |agency=Reuters  |date= 2007-06-19|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref> Nike has also been praised for its [[Nike Grind]] program (which closes the [[Product lifecycle (marketing)|product lifecycle]]) by groups like [[Climate Counts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climatecounts.org/scorecompany.php?co=43 |title=Nike |publisher=ClimateCounts |accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref> One campaign that Nike began for Earth Day 2008 was a commercial that featured basketball star [[Steve Nash]] wearing Nike's Trash Talk Shoe, which had been constructed in February 2008 from pieces of leather and synthetic leather waste from factory floors. The Trash Talk Shoe also featured a sole composed of ground-up rubber from a shoe recycling program. Nike claims this is the first performance basketball shoe that has been created from manufacturing waste, but it only produced 5,000 pairs for sale.<ref>[http://www.brandweek.com/bw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003793129&imw=Y ]{{dead link|date=September 2010}} <!-- April 23, 2008. Retrieved: May 4, 2008 --></ref>

Another project Nike has begun is called Nike's Reuse-A-Shoe program. This program, started in 1993, is Nike's longest-running program that benefits both the environment and the community by collecting old athletic shoes of any type in order to process and recycle them. The material that is produced is then used to help create sports surfaces such as basketball courts, running tracks, and playgrounds.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/lexington/news/business/x883026486 |title=Wicked Local |date=April 29, 2008 |accessdate=May 4, 2008 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

A project through the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] found workers were exposed to toxic [[isocyanate]]s and other chemicals in footwear factories in [[Thailand]]. In addition to inhalation, dermal exposure was the biggest problem found.  This could result in allergic reactions including asthmatic reactions.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Todd |first=L.

==Marketing strategy==
Nike promotes its products by [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship agreements]] with celebrity athletes, professional teams and college athletic teams.

===Advertising===
In 1982, Nike aired its first national television ads, created by newly formed ad agency [[Wieden+Kennedy]] (W+K), during the broadcast of the [[New York Marathon]]. The Cannes Advertising Festival has named Nike its Advertiser of the Year in 1994 and 2003, making it the first company to receive that honor twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/4121690-1.html |title=Nike's Knight Is Advertiser of the Year &#124; Marketing & Advertising > Marketing & Advertising Overview from |publisher=AllBusiness.com |accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref>

Nike also has earned the [[Emmy Award]] for best commercial twice since the award was first created in the 1990s. The first was for "The Morning After," a satirical look at what a runner might face on the morning of January 1, 2000 if every dire prediction about the [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K problem]] came to fruition.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fass |first=Allison |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CEFDA1430F932A0575BC0A9669C8B63 |title=The Media Business – Advertising – Addenda – Nike Spot Wins An Emmy Award |work=New York Times |date=2000-08-31 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref> The second was for a 2002 spot called "Move," which featured a series of famous and everyday athletes in a variety of athletic pursuits.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rutenberg |first=Jim |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E6D61130F933A1575AC0A9649C8B63&n=Top%2FNews%2FBusiness%2FCompanies%2FNike%20Inc |title=The Media Business – Advertising – Addenda – Nike Spot Wins An Emmy Award |work=New York Times |date=2002-09-20 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref>

====Beatles song====
Nike was criticized for its use of the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song "[[Revolution (song)|Revolution]]" in a 1987 commercial against the wishes of [[Apple Records]], the Beatles' recording company.  Nike paid US$250,000 to [[Capitol Records]] Inc., which held the North American licensing rights to the recordings, for the right to use the Beatles' rendition for a year.

Apple sued Nike Inc., Capitol Records Inc., [[EMI|EMI Records]] Inc. and Wieden+Kennedy for $15&nbsp;million.<ref>According to a July 28, 1987 article written by the [[Associated Press]].</ref>  Capitol-EMI countered by saying the lawsuit was "groundless" because Capitol had licensed the use of "Revolution" with the "active support and encouragement of [[Yoko Ono]], a shareholder and director of Apple."

Nike discontinued airing ads featuring "Revolution" in March 1988. Yoko Ono later gave permission to Nike to use [[John Lennon]]'s "Instant Karma" in another advertisement.

====New media marketing====
Nike was an early adopter of [[internet marketing]], [[email management]] technologies, and using [[broadcast]] and [[narrowcasting|narrowcast]] communication technologies to create multimedia marketing campaigns.

====Minor Threat advertisement====
In late June 2005, Nike received criticism from [[Ian MacKaye]], owner of [[Dischord Records]], guitarist/vocalist for [[Fugazi]] and [[The Evens]], and front man of the defunct punk band [[Minor Threat]], for appropriating imagery and text from Minor Threat's [[First Two 7"s on a 12"|1981 self-titled album]]'s cover art in a flyer promoting [[Nike Skateboarding]]'s 2005 East Coast demo tour. {{-}}
On June 27, Nike Skateboarding's website issued an apology to Dischord, Minor Threat, and fans of both and announced that they have tried to remove and dispose of all flyers. They stated that the people who designed it were skateboarders and Minor Threat fans themselves who created the advertisement out of respect and appreciation for the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nike.com/nikeskateboarding/v2/letter/index.html |title=Skateboarding |publisher=Nike |accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref>  The dispute was eventually settled out of court between Nike and Minor Threat.

====Nike 6.0====
As part of the 6.0 campaign, Nike introduced a new line of T-shirts that include phrases such as "Dope", "Get High" and "Ride Pipe" – sports lingo that is also a [[double entendre]] for [[Recreational drug use|drug use]]. Boston Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] expressed his objection to the shirts after seeing them in a window display at the city's [[Niketown]] and asked the store to remove the display. "What we don't need is a major corporation like Nike, which tries to appeal to the younger generation, out there giving credence to the drug issue," Menino told ''[[The Boston Herald]]''. A company official stated the shirts were meant to pay homage to extreme sports, and that Nike does not condone the illegal use of drugs.<ref>{{cite news | first = Allan | last = Brettman | title = Nike courts controversy, publicity with drug-themed skater shirts |  publisher=The Oregonian | date = June 22, 2011 | url = http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2011/06/nike_courts_controversy_public.html | accessdate = 2011-06-24}}</ref> Nike was forced to replace the shirt line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stocksandshares.tv/nike-inc-nysenke-facing-slogan-backlash/3209121 |title=Nike Inc.

===NBA uniform and apparel deal===
In June 2015, Nike signed an 8-year deal with the [[NBA]] to become the official apparel supplier for the league, beginning with the 2017–18 season. The brand takes over for [[Adidas]], who provided the uniforms and apparel for the league since 2006. Unlike previous deals, Nike's logo will appear on NBA game jerseys – a first for the league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2015/06/11/nike-signs-8-year-deal-with-nba/ |title=Nike Signs 8-Year Deal With NBA |publisher=BallerStatus.com |date=June 11, 2015}}</ref>

==Sponsorship==
[[File:Mario Götze, Germany national football team (02).jpg|thumb|left|Nike sponsors [[Mario Götze]] and many other players and clubs in football]]

Nike pays top athletes in many sports to use their products and [[promotion (marketing)|promote]] and advertise their technology and design.

Nike's first professional athlete endorser was Romanian tennis player [[Ilie Năstase]]. The first track endorser was distance runner [[Steve Prefontaine]]. Prefontaine was the prized pupil of the company's co-founder, [[Bill Bowerman]], while he coached at the University of Oregon. Today, the Steve Prefontaine Building is named in his honor at Nike's corporate headquarters.

Nike has also sponsored many other successful [[track and field]] athletes over the years, such as [[Carl Lewis]], [[Jackie Joyner-Kersee]] and [[Sebastian Coe]].  The signing of basketball player [[Michael Jordan]] in 1984, with his subsequent promotion of Nike over the course of his career, with [[Spike Lee]] as [[Mars Blackmon]], proved to be one of the biggest boosts to Nike's publicity and sales.

Nike has been the official kit sponsor for the [[Indian cricket team]] since 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/30804/team-india-gets-new-nike-odi-kit/ |title=Team India's new NIKE ODI kit |publisher=Cricbuzz.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketliveguide.com/2010/09/29/new-nike-odi-team-kit-for-indian-cricket-team/ |title=Indian Cricket team's NIKE ODI kit |publisher=Cricketliveguide.com |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref>

Nike is a major sponsor of the athletic programs at [[Penn State University]] and named its first child care facility after [[Joe Paterno]] when it opened in 1990 at the company's headquarters. Nike originally announced it would not remove Paterno's name from the building in the wake of the Penn State sex abuse scandal. After the Freeh Report was released on July 12, 2012, Nike CEO Mark Parker announced the name Joe Paterno would be removed immediately from the child development center. A new name has yet to be announced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paterno's name off child care center|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/collegefootball/story/president-of-nike-mark-parker-deicdes-to-change-name-of-joe-paterno-child-development-center-at-company-headquarters-071212|publisher=FOX Sports|accessdate=12 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Joe Paterno's Name Removed From Child Development Center at Nike Headquarters|url=http://www.nesn.com/2012/07/joe-paternos-name-removed-from-child-development-center-at-nike-headquarters.html|publisher=NESN.com|accessdate=12 July 2012}}</ref>

Nike also sponsored association football players such as [[Ronaldinho]], [[Ronaldo]], [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Didier Drogba]], [[Neymar]], [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]], [[Thierry Henry]], [[Wayne Rooney]], [[Francesco Totti]], [[Andrés Iniesta]] and [[Landon Donovan]] among others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nikemedia.com.br/futebol/atletas/ |title=Jogadores de Futebol Patrocinados pela Nike |publisher=Nike Brasil |accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref>

In January 2013, Nike signed [[Rory McIlroy]], the then No 1 golfer in the world to a 10-year sponsorship deal worth $250 million. The deal includes using Nike's range of [[golf club]]s, a move [[Nick Faldo]] previously described as "dangerous" for McIlroy's game.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|author=Tom Fordyce |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/golf/21018786 |title=Rory McIlroy, Nike and the $250m, 10-year sponsorship deal |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-01-14 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref>

On February 21, 2013, Nike announced it suspended its contract with South African athlete [[Oscar Pistorius]], due to his being charged with [[premeditated murder]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Oscar Pistorius dropped by Nike|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2013/02/21/oscar-pistorius-nike-suspends-contract/1935109/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=21 February 2013|first1=Roxanna|last1=Scott|date=February 21, 2013}}</ref>

In August 2014, Nike announced that they will not renew their kit supply deal with Manchester United after the 2014–15 season, citing rising costs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Premier League: Sportswear giants Nike to end Manchester United sponsorship|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12040/9375980/premier-league-sportswear-giants-nike-to-end-manchester-united-sponsorship|accessdate=7 August 2014|newspaper=Sky Sports|date=7 August 2014|location=London}}</ref> Since the start of the 2015–16 season, Adidas has manufactured Manchester United's kit as part of a world-record 10-year deal worth a minimum of £750 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Manchester United sign record 10-year kit deal with Adidas worth £750m|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/14/manchester-united-kit-deal-adidas|accessdate=14 July 2014|newspaper=Sky Sports|date=14 July 2014|location=London}}</ref>

In 2012, Nike is listed as a partner of the (RED) campaign, together with other brands such as Girl, American Express and Converse. The campaign's mission is to prevent the transmission of the HIV virus from mother to child by 2015 (the campaign's byline is "Fighting For An AIDS Free Generation").<ref>{{cite web|title=(RED) Partners|url=http://www.joinred.com/aboutred/red-partners/|work=(RED)|publisher=(RED), a division of The ONE Campaign|accessdate=13 October 2012|year=2012}}</ref>
